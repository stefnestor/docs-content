    3. Enter a name for the index where the data will be stored, then click **Import** again to complete the process.

    ::::

After the uploaded data is imported into the specified {{es}} index, you can start exploring it. For more details, refer to [Explore and analyze](/explore-analyze/index.md).

::::{important}
The upload feature is not intended for use as part of a repeated production process, but rather for the initial exploration of your data.

## Required privileges

The {{stack-security-features}} provide roles and privileges that control which users can upload files. To upload a file in {{kib}} and import it into an {{es}} index, you’ll need:

* `manage_pipeline` or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges for the index
* `all` {{kib}} privileges for **Discover** and **Data Views Management**

You can manage your roles, privileges, and spaces in **{{stack-manage-app}}**.
