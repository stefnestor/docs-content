# Index operations reference [performing-operations-on-indices]

The following operations are available from the **Manage index** menu on the **{{index-manage-app}}** page in {{kib}}. Select one or more indices and open the menu to access these actions. Some operations are unavailable in {{serverless-full}} because data management tasks are handled automatically.

## Available index operations

The following operations are available from the **Manage index** menu. Some operations are unavailable in {{serverless-full}} because data management tasks are handled automatically.

**Show index overview** {applies_to}`stack: ga` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   View an overview of the index, including its storage size, status, and aliases, as well as a sample API request to add new documents.

**Show index settings** {applies_to}`stack: ga` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   View a list of the currently configured [index settings](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/index.md). Turn on **Edit mode** to add or change settings.

**Show index mapping** {applies_to}`stack: ga` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   View the [index mappings](/manage-data/data-store/mapping.md). From this page you can set up new mappings for the field types in your index.

**Show index stats** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   View statistics for your index. Statistics are compiled by `primaries`, representing values only for primary shards, and by `total`, representing accumulated values for both primary and replica shards. Refer to the [get index statistics]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-stats) API for details.

**Close index** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Close the index so that read or write operations cannot be performed. Refer to the [close index]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-close) API for details.

**Open index** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Reopen an index that is currently closed to read and write operations. This option is available only for indices that are currently closed. Refer to the [open index]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-open) API for details.

**Force merge index** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Reduce the number of segments in each shard by merging some of them together and free up the space used by deleted documents. Refer to the [force merge]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-forcemerge) API for details.

**Refresh index** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Refresh the index to make recent operations available for search. Refer to the [refresh index]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-refresh) API for details.

**Clear index cache** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Clear all caches for the index. Refer to the [clear cache]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-clear-cache) API for details.

**Flush index** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Flush the index to permanently write all data currently in the transaction log to the Lucene index. Refer to the [flush index]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-flush) API for details.

**Delete index** {applies_to}`stack: ga` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   Delete an index including all of its documents, shards, and metadata. Refer to the [delete index]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-indices-delete) API for details.

**Add lifecycle policy** {applies_to}`stack: ga`
:   Add a lifecycle policy to manage how the index transitions over time. The policy governs how the index moves through phases (`hot`, `warm`, `cold`, `frozen`, and `delete`) and what actions are performed during each phase (for example, shrinking and downsampling). Refer to [{{ilm-cap}}](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management.md) for details.

**Convert to lookup index** {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.2` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
:   Convert the index to a lookup mode index that can be used with [`LOOKUP JOIN`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-lookup-join) commands, so that data from the index can be added to {{esql}} query results. This option is available only for single shard indices with fewer than two billion documents. Refer to the {{es}} [`index.mode`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/index-modules.md#index-mode-setting) index setting for details.
