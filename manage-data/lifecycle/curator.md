# Elasticsearch Curator

{{es}} Curator is a tool that helps you automate and manage index lifecycles, providing advanced control over your {{es}} data. While most use cases are now handled by {{ilm-cap}} ({{ilm-init}})—included with a Basic license—Curator remains a valuable option for scenarios requiring additional functionality or customization.

* If {{ilm-init}} provides the functionality to manage your index lifecycle and you have at least a Basic license, use {{ilm-init}} instead of Curator. Many {{stack}} components use {{ilm-init}} by default.

* If you're looking for additional functionality for managing your index lifecycle, you can read more in [Curator index management](curator://reference/index.md) about how {{es}} Curator can help for your use case.
