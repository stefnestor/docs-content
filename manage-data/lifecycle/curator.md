# Elasticsearch Curator

Similar to {{ilm-cap}} ({{ilm-init}}), Elasticsearch Curator can help you manage index lifecycles. **If {{ilm-init}} provides the functionality to manage your index lifecycle and you have at least a Basic license, use {{ilm-init}} instead of Curator.** Many {{stack}} components use {{ilm-init}} by default.

If you're looking for additional functionality for managing your index lifecycle, you can read more about how Elasticsearch Curator may help in [Curator index management](curator://reference/index.md).
