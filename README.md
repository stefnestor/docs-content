## Contribute

If you find any bugs in our documentation, or want to request an enhancement, then you can open an issue using our template. We also welcome contributions in the form of PRs. Before you submit a PR, make sure that you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.elastic.co/contributor-agreement/).

This documentation uses a custom syntax written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). In many cases, you only need to know plain markdown to contribute. We'll add a public component reference and additional contribution guidelines in future. Elasticians can refer to our [internal syntax reference](https://docs.elastic.dev/docsmobile/syntax).
