# Troubleshoot APM iOS Agent [troubleshooting]

Is something not working as expected? Don’t worry if you can’t figure out what the problem is; we’re here to help! As a first step, ensure your app is compatible with the agent’s [supported technologies](apm-agent-ios://reference/supported-technologies.md).

If you’re an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the [Elastic Support portal](https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/). Other users can post in the [APM discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm).

::::{important}
**Please upload your complete debug logs** to a service like [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) so that we can analyze the problem. Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.
