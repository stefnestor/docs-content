# Check {{kib}} server status [access]
% The fastest way to access {{kib}} is to use our hosted {{es}} Service. If you [installed {{kib}} on your own](../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-kibana.md), access {{kib}} through the web application.
% 
% 
% ## Set up on cloud [_set_up_on_cloud]
% 
% There’s no faster way to get started than with {{ecloud}}:
% 
% 1. [Get a free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
% 2. Log into [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
% 3. Click **Create deployment**.
% 4. Give your deployment a name.
% 5. Click **Create deployment** and download the password for the `elastic` user.
% 
% That’s it! Now that you are up and running, it’s time to get some data into {{kib}}. {{kib}} will open as soon as your deployment is ready.
% 
% 
% ## Log on to the web application [log-on-to-the-web-application]
% 
% If you are using a self-managed deployment, access {{kib}} through the web application on port 5601.
% 
% 1. Point your web browser to the machine where you are running {{kib}} and specify the port number. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.
% 
%     To remotely connect to {{kib}}, set [server.host](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/general-settings.md#server-host) to a non-loopback address.
% 
% 2. Log on to your account.
% 3. Go to the home page, then click **{{kib}}**.
% 4. To make the {{kib}} page your landing page, click **Make this my landing page**.
% 
% 
% ## Check the {{kib}} status [status]
% 

% cf (../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/access.md#status) 

The status page displays information about the server resource usage and installed plugins. It only reports for the individual responding {{kib}} instance.

To view {{kib}}'s status, use the `status` endpoint. For example, `localhost:5601/status`.

:::

For JSON-formatted server status details, use the [{{kib}} current status API]({{kib-apis}}v9/operation/operation-get-status). For example, `localhost:5601/api/status`.

## Triage {{kib}} health using the status API [access-triage]

The following steps demonstrate a typical investigative flow. It assumes the [{{kib}} current status API]({{kib-apis}}v9/operation/operation-get-status) is saved locally as `kibana_status.json`, and uses third-party tool [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) as a JSON processor.

1. Check the overall status.

   The UI will report "Kibana status is" and then the status. You can see this in the API output by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cat kibana_status.json | jq '{ overall: .status.overall.level }'
   ```
    
2. Check the core plugins.

    The UI includes a **Plugin status** table with a list of plugins. IDs for core plugins use a prefix of `core`. 
    
    You can check these in the API output by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cat kibana_status.json | jq -r '.status.core|{ elasticsearch: .elasticsearch.level, savedObjects: .savedObjects.level }'
    ```

     Before you review any further plugins, check that the `elasticsearch` and `savedObjects` are healthy and resolve any issues:
  
    * If the connection to {{es}} is unhealthy, refer to [](/troubleshoot/kibana/error-server-not-ready.md).
    * If the connection to Saved Objects is unhealthy, refer to [](/troubleshoot/kibana/migration-failures.md).

3. Check non-core plugins.

    The UI **Plugin Status** list reports the status of the other plugins running on the instance. Plugins can be dependent upon each other. You should first check the health of the common underlying plugins: `alerting`, `reporting`, `ruleRegistry`, `savedObjects`, `security`, and `taskManager`. 
    
    You can check these in the API output by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cat kibana_status.json | jq -rc '.status.plugins|to_entries[]|select(.key=="taskManager" or .key=="savedObjects" or .key=="security" or .key=="reporting" or .key=="ruleRegistry" or .key=="alerting") |{plugin:.key, status:.value.level, reason:.value.summary}'
    ```

    For an example of a degraded Task Manager and how that degradation cascades into other plugins, refer to [Troubleshooting Kibana health](https://www.elastic.co/blog/troubleshooting-kibana-health#check-dependencies). For more information on investigating a degraded Task Manager, refer to [](/troubleshoot/kibana/task-manager.md).
