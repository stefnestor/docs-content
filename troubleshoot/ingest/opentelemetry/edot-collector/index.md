# Troubleshoot the EDOT Collector

Use the topics in this section to troubleshoot issues with the EDOT Collector.

If you're not sure where to start, review the Collector's logs for error messages and validate your configuration using the `--dry-run` option. For more detailed diagnostics, refer to [Enable debug logging](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/enable-debug-logging.md).

## Resource issues

* [Collector out of memory](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/collector-oomkilled.md): Diagnose and resolve out-of-memory issues in the EDOT Collector using Go's Performance Profiler.

* [Insufficient resources in {{k8s}}](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/insufficient-resources-kubestack.md): Troubleshoot resource allocation issues when running the EDOT Collector in {{k8s}} environments.

## Configuration issues

* [Collector doesn't start](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/collector-not-starting.md): Resolve startup failures caused by invalid configuration, port conflicts, or missing components.

* [Missing or incomplete traces due to Collector sampling](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/misconfigured-sampling-collector.md): Troubleshoot missing or incomplete traces caused by sampling configuration.

* [Collector doesn't propagate client metadata](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/metadata.md): Learn why the Collector doesn't extract custom attributes and how to propagate such values using EDOT SDKs.

## Connectivity and export issues

* [Export failures when sending telemetry data](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/trace-export-errors.md): Resolve export failures caused by `sending_queue` overflow and {{es}} exporter timeouts.

## Debugging

* [Enable debug logging](/troubleshoot/ingest/opentelemetry/edot-collector/enable-debug-logging.md): Learn how to enable debug logging for the EDOT Collector in supported environments.
