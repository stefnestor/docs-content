# `ResourceExhausted` errors in Collector-to-Collector pipelines

This troubleshooting guide helps you diagnose and resolve `rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted` errors that occur in Collector-to-Collector pipelines when using {{agent}}s. These errors typically indicate that one or more resource limits, such as gRPC message size, decompression memory, or internal buffering, have been exceeded.

The root cause depends on your pipeline architecture (number of Collectors, transport, batching, and queue settings). Each case is different; use the diagnosis and resolution steps in this document to narrow down the cause and experiment with mitigations.

This issue is most often reported in the following setups:

- Agent to Gateway Collector architectures
- Multiple Collectors sending to a single Gateway
- {{k8s}} environments with autoscaling workloads
- Large clusters where a single collection interval produces large payloads (for example, cluster-wide metrics)
- Pipelines exporting large batches, such as:
  - Traces with large or numerous attributes
  - Logs with large payloads

## Symptoms

You might observe one or more of the following:

- {{agent}} logs containing messages similar to:
  - `rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted`
  - Errors mentioning message size, decompression, or resource exhaustion
- Telemetry data (traces, metrics, or logs) partially or completely dropped
- Increased retry activity or growing queues in contrib Collectors
- Downstream Collectors appearing healthy but ingesting less data than expected
- Issues that occur primarily when:
  - Multiple Collectors are chained together
  - Traffic volume increases suddenly (deployments, load tests, traffic spikes)

### Common log pattern

A frequent variant of this error looks like:

`rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message after decompression larger than max (4194305 vs. 4194304)`

This typically means the receiving side enforces the gRPC library default maximum receive message size (commonly ~4 MiB) and the incoming payload exceeded it by a small amount.

This limit is not derived from pod CPU/memory sizing. It is primarily a protocol or configuration limit (unless you explicitly configure different limits).

## Causes

`ResourceExhausted` errors indicate that a configured or implicit limit has been exceeded. In Collector-to-Collector pipelines, this is commonly caused by a combination of gRPC limits, memory pressure, and backpressure propagation.

### gRPC message size limits (OTLP receiver)

When using the standard [OTLP receiver (`otlp`) with gRPC protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver/otlpreceiver):

- The {{agent}} inherits contrib OpenTelemetry Collector behavior.
- If `max_recv_msg_size_mib` is not explicitly configured, the Collector uses the [gRPC library default](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc#MaxRecvMsgSize), which is 4 MiB.
- Messages larger than this limit result in a `ResourceExhausted` error sent by the receiving side and logged on the sending side.

This limit is configurable. For all gRPC server options, see the [OTLP receiver gRPC server configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md#server-configuration). You can also limit payload size on the sending side using the exporter's [sending queue batch settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/v0.144.0/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#sending-queue-batch-settings) (for example, `max_size`) or the batch processor's `send_batch_max_size` (see below). The sending queue supports a byte-based sizer option for staying under size limits, at the cost of some performance overhead. For example:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        max_recv_msg_size_mib: <value>
```

Even without a `batch` processor, some receivers can produce large payloads per collection interval.
For example, cluster-wide metrics can generate tens of thousands of data points in a single cycle. If a single export attempt exceeds the gRPC receive limit, the sending Collector might drop the entire payload for that attempt.

### Decompression and memory limits (Apache Arrow receiver)

When using OTLP with Apache Arrow (`otelarrowreceiver`), the Collector enforces explicit resource limits:

| Limit | Default | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `admission.request_limit_mib` | 128 MiB | Maximum uncompressed request size |
| `arrow.memory_limit_mib` | 128 MiB | Concurrent memory used by Arrow buffers |
| `arrow.zstd.memory_limit_mib` | 128 MiB per stream | Memory dedicated to Zstd decompression |
| `admission.waiting_limit_mib` | 32 MiB | Requests waiting for admission (backpressure control) |

Exceeding any of these limits results in a `ResourceExhausted` error. All limits are configurable under `receivers.otelarrow`.

### Backpressure propagation across Collectors

In pipelines with multiple Collectors:

- A downstream Collector might become saturated (CPU, memory, or queue limits).
- Contrib Collectors continue sending data until their sending queues fill, or retry limits are exhausted.

This can surface as `ResourceExhausted` errors even if the downstream Collector appears healthy.

### Batching and queue configuration mismatches

- Export payloads that are too large can exceed gRPC receiver limits.
- Sending queues might fill faster than they can be drained during sudden traffic increases.
- Multiple Collectors competing for shared node resources (common in {{k8s}}) amplify the effect.

## Diagnosis

To identify the cause, inspect both the sending and receiving Collectors.

### Identify where the error originates

- Inspect logs on both contrib and downstream Collectors.
- Note which Collector reports the `ResourceExhausted` error (for example, on the exporter side or the receiver side).

### Confirm the transport and receiver

Determine whether traffic uses:

- OTLP/gRPC (`otlpreceiver`)
- OTLP with Apache Arrow (`otelarrowreceiver`)

### Review configured limits

- For OTLP/gRPC:
  - `max_recv_msg_size_mib` on the receiving Collector
- For Apache Arrow:
  - `admission.request_limit_mib`
  - `arrow.memory_limit_mib`
  - `arrow.zstd.memory_limit_mib`
  - `admission.waiting_limit_mib`

### Use internal telemetry to distinguish sender versus receiver problems

**On the sending Collector (exporter-side)**

Look for evidence that the exporter cannot enqueue or send:

- `otelcol_exporter_queue_size` and `otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity`
- `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points` / `_spans` / `_log_records`
- `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points` / `_spans` / `_log_records`

If `queue_size` stays near `queue_capacity` and enqueue failures increase, the sender is under pressure (often because the receiver cannot keep up). With `service.telemetry.metrics.level: detailed`, the histograms `otelcol_exporter_queue_batch_send_size` and `otelcol_exporter_queue_batch_send_size_bytes` show request sizes.

**On the receiving Collector (receiver-side)**

Look for evidence of refusal/backpressure and resource saturation:

- `otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points` / `_spans` / `_log_records`
- Process resource metrics such as:
  - `otelcol_process_memory_rss`
  - `otelcol_process_runtime_heap_alloc_bytes`
  - `otelcol_process_cpu_seconds`
- The OTLP receiver's `rpc_server_request_size` histogram shows request sizes (requires detailed metrics level).

Also check {{k8s}} signals:
- Pod restarts / `CrashLoopBackOff`
- `OOMKilled` events
- CPU throttling

### Correlate with load patterns

Check whether errors coincide with:

- Deployments
- Traffic spikes
- Load tests
- Large cluster-wide metric collection intervals

## Resolution

Apply one or more of the following mitigations, starting with the most likely based on your diagnosis.

### Increase gRPC receiver limits on the receiving Collector

If you observe `received message after decompression larger than max (… versus 4194304)` in your logs, increase the receiver's `max_recv_msg_size_mib` on the receiving Collector (commonly the gateway):

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: ${env:MY_POD_IP}:4317
        max_recv_msg_size_mib: 16
```

Increase this cautiously:
- Larger limits allow larger payloads but might increase memory usage.
- Validate gateway stability (CPU/memory) after the change.

### Reduce payload size from the sending Collector

If the sending Collector is exporting payloads that exceed receiver limits, reduce the payload size by adding batching or filtering unnecessary data:

#### Add batching to high-volume pipelines

If a sender exports large metric payloads per cycle, split exports into smaller requests. Prefer batching in the [exporter's sending queue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/v0.144.0/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#sending-queue-batch-settings) (for example, `max_size`) over the batch processor, as the batch processor can be unreliable for enforcing batch size. If you use the batch processor, set `send_batch_max_size` to enforce batch size limits; `send_batch_size` only acts as a trigger and does not limit the size of batches sent downstream. Because batching limits are count-based (data points, log records, or spans), you might need to tune iteratively.

Example (adding batch size limits to a cluster-stats metrics pipeline using the batch processor):

```yaml
processors:
  batch/metrics:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 8192 # Send when this many items are ready (default: 8192). Must be <= send_batch_max_size.
    send_batch_max_size: 8192 # Maximum number of items per batch sent to the next component. Use with timeout to control when batches are sent.

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors:
        - batch/metrics
        - k8sattributes
        - resourcedetection/eks
        - resourcedetection/gcp
        - resourcedetection/aks
        - resource/k8s
        - resource/hostname
      exporters: [otlp/gateway]
```

#### Reduce high-volume or high-cardinality content

If possible, reduce payload size by:
- Turning off unnecessary metrics in receivers
- Removing large attributes when safe for your use case
- Filtering high-cardinality labels/attributes early in the pipeline

:::{note}
High cardinality (too many unique metric or attribute values) can impact costs and query performance. When telemetry data contains many unique combinations of attributes, labels, or metric names, it increases the volume of data stored and indexed, which might increase billing costs depending on your subscription model. Additionally, high cardinality can affect query performance in {{kib}} when analyzing your data.

### Tune exporter queue and retry behavior to reduce drops during transient overload

If drops happen during sudden traffic increases or temporary downstream slowdowns, turn on and tune queued retry on the sending exporter. 

Using persistent storage for the sending queue (for example, `storage: file_storage`) helps avoid losing data on Collector restart. Configure `max_elapsed_time: 0` on retry to retry indefinitely; the default stops after about 5 minutes and drops data.

Configuration keys depend on the exporter and distribution, but commonly include:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp/gateway:
    endpoint: "<gateway-service>:4317" # OTLP/gRPC endpoint (port 4317)
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      queue_size: 10000
      storage: file_storage
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      max_elapsed_time: 0  # Retry indefinitely; default stops after ~5 minutes and drops data
```

### Address backpressure by scaling and properly sizing the receiving Collector

If the gateway is restarting, `OOMKilled`, or cannot export fast enough:

- Increase gateway CPU/memory limits.
- Increase gateway replicas.
- Ensure environment limits align with container memory.
- If the gateway Collector is autoscaled, consider autoscaling based on the Collector's queue size instead of (or in addition to) CPU or memory usage.

### Protect against memory exhaustion

Memory protection relies on the `memory_limiter` processor and careful tuning of batching, queues, and receiver limits:

- Configure the `memory_limiter` processor early in the pipeline.
- Set limits based on available memory and workload characteristics.

## Best practices

To prevent `ResourceExhausted` errors in Collector-to-Collector architectures:

- Design pipelines with sufficient capacity at each Collector in the pipeline.
- Test under realistic peak load conditions (including burst traffic patterns).
- Monitor both sides:
  - Exporter queue utilization and send failures on the sender.
  - Receiver refused metrics and resource usage on the receiver.
- Standardize batch and queue settings across environments.
- Minimize unnecessary Collector chaining.
