# Diagnose unassigned shards [diagnose-unassigned-shards]

:::{include} /deploy-manage/_snippets/autoops-callout-with-ech.md
:::

An unassigned shard is a shard that exists in the cluster metadata but is not currently allocated to any node, which means its data is unavailable for both search and indexing operations.

Shards can become unassigned for many reasons, such as node failures, cluster or indices configuration, insufficient resources, or allocation rules that prevent {{es}} from placing the shard on any available node.

Unassigned shards directly affects the cluster health status:

* If at least one replica shard is unassigned, the cluster health becomes yellow. The cluster can still serve all data, but redundancy is reduced.
* If at least one primary shard is unassigned, the cluster health becomes red. In this state, some data is unavailable, and affected indices cannot fully operate.

To diagnose the unassigned shards in your deployment, use the following steps. You can use either [API console](/explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md), or direct [{{es}} API](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/index.md) calls.

1. View the unassigned shards using the [cat shards API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-shards).

    ```console
    GET _cat/shards?v=true&h=index,shard,prirep,state,node,unassigned.reason&s=state&format=json
    ```

    The response looks like this:

    ```console-result
    [
      {
        "index": "my-index-000001",
        "shard": "0",
        "prirep": "p",
        "state": "UNASSIGNED",
        "node": null,
        "unassigned.reason": "INDEX_CREATED"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Unassigned shards have a `state` of `UNASSIGNED`. The `prirep` value is `p` for primary shards and `r` for replicas.

    The index in the example has a primary shard unassigned.

2. To understand why an unassigned shard is not being assigned and what action you must take to allow {{es}} to assign it, use the [cluster allocation explanation API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-allocation-explain).

    ```console
    GET _cluster/allocation/explain
    {
      "index": "my-index-000001", <1>
      "shard": 0, <2>
      "primary": true <3>
    }
    ```

    1. The index we want to diagnose.
    2. The unassigned shard ID.
    3. Indicates that we are diagnosing a primary shard.


    The response looks like this:

    ```console-result
    {
      "index" : "my-index-000001",
      "shard" : 0,
      "primary" : true,
      "current_state" : "unassigned",                 <1>
      "unassigned_info" : {
        "reason" : "INDEX_CREATED",                   <2>
        "at" : "2022-01-04T18:08:16.600Z",
        "last_allocation_status" : "no"
      },
      "can_allocate" : "no",                          <3>
      "allocate_explanation" : "Elasticsearch isn't allowed to allocate this shard to any of the nodes in the cluster. Choose a node to which you expect this shard to be allocated, find this node in the node-by-node explanation, and address the reasons which prevent Elasticsearch from allocating this shard there.",
      "node_allocation_decisions" : [
        {
          "node_id" : "8qt2rY-pT6KNZB3-hGfLnw",
          "node_name" : "node-0",
          "transport_address" : "127.0.0.1:9401",
          "roles": ["data_content", "data_hot"],
          "node_attributes" : {},
          "node_decision" : "no",                     <4>
          "weight_ranking" : 1,
          "deciders" : [
            {
              "decider" : "filter",                   <5>
              "decision" : "NO",
              "explanation" : "node does not match index setting [index.routing.allocation.include] filters [_name:\"nonexistent_node\"]"  <6>
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    4. The current state of the shard.
    5. The reason for the shard originally becoming unassigned.
    6. Whether to allocate the shard.
    7. Whether to allocate the shard to the particular node.
    8. The decider which led to the `no` decision for the node.
    9. An explanation as to why the decider returned a `no` decision, with a helpful hint pointing to the setting that led to the decision.

6. The explanation in our case indicates the index allocation configurations are not correct. To review your allocation settings, use the [get index settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) and [cluster get settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-get-settings) APIs.

    ```console
    GET my-index-000001/_settings?flat_settings=true&include_defaults=true

    GET _cluster/settings?flat_settings=true&include_defaults=true
    ```

7. Change the settings using the [update index settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) and [cluster update settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-put-settings) APIs to the correct values to allow the index to be allocated.

For more guidance on fixing the most common causes for unassigned shards, follow [](red-yellow-cluster-status.md#fix-red-yellow-cluster-status), refer to [](/troubleshoot/elasticsearch/cluster-allocation-api-examples.md), or contact [Elastic Support](https://support.elastic.co).

## Common issues

The following sections provide advice for resolving some of the common causes for unassigned shards.

### Conflicting settings

A primary shard might be unassigned due to conflicting settings.
View [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z3n2VgusLE) for a walkthrough of troubleshooting a node and index setting mismatch.

### Maximum number of retries exceeded [maximum-retries-exceeded]

When {{es}} is unable to allocate a shard, it attempts to retry allocation up to the maximum number of retries allowed.
After this, {{es}} stops attempting to allocate the shard to prevent infinite retries, which might impact cluster performance.
You can use an API to [reroute the cluster]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-cluster-reroute), which allocates the shard if the issue preventing allocation has been resolved. For example:

```console
POST _cluster/reroute?retry_failed
```

### No valid shard copy [no-shard-copy]

If a shard is unassigned with an allocation status of `no_valid_shard_copy`, you should make sure that all nodes are in the cluster. If all the nodes containing in-sync copies of a shard are lost, then you can recover the data for the shard.

View [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OAg9IyXFO4) for a walkthrough of troubleshooting `no_valid_shard_copy`.
