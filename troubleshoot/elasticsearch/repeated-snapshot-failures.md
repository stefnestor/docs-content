# Fix repeated snapshot policy failures [repeated-snapshot-failures]

Repeated snapshot failures are usually an indicator of a problem with your deployment. Continuous failures of automated snapshots can leave a deployment without recovery options in cases of data loss or outages.

:::{include} /deploy-manage/_snippets/autoops-callout-with-ech.md
:::

{{es}} keeps track of the number of repeated failures when executing automated snapshots with [{{slm}} ({{slm-init}})](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/create-snapshots.md#automate-snapshots-slm) policies. If an automated snapshot fails too many times without a successful execution, the health API reports a warning. The number of repeated failures before reporting a warning is controlled by the [`slm.health.failed_snapshot_warn_threshold`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/snapshot-restore-settings.md#slm-health-failed-snapshot-warn-threshold) setting.

## Review snapshot policy failures

If an automated {{slm-init}} policy execution is experiencing repeated failures, follow these steps to get more information about the problem:

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Using {{kib}}
In {{kib}}, you can view all configured {{slm-init}} policies and review their status and execution history. If the UI does not provide sufficient details about the failure, use the Console to retrieve the [snapshot policy information](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-slm-get-lifecycle) with the {{es}} API.

1. Go to **Snapshot and Restore > Policies** to see the list of configured policies. You can find the **Snapshot and Restore** management page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

2. The policies table lists all configured policies. Click on any of the policies to review the details and execution history.

3. To get more detailed information about the failure, open {{kib}} **Dev Tools > Console**. You can find the **Console** using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

    Once the Console is open, execute the steps described in the **Using the {{es}} API** tab to retrieve the affected {{slm-init}} policy information.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Using the {{es}} API
The following step can be run using either [{{kib}} console](/explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md) or direct [{{es}} API](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/index.md) calls.

[Retrieve the affected {{slm-init}} policy](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-slm-get-lifecycle):

```console
GET _slm/policy/<affected-policy-name>
```

The response looks like this:

```console-result

1. The affected snapshot lifecycle policy.
2. The information about the last failure for the policy.
3. The time when the failure occurred in millis. Use the `human=true` request parameter to see a formatted timestamp.
4. Error details containing the reason for the snapshot failure.

## Possible causes

Snapshots can fail for a variety of reasons. If the failures are due to configuration errors, consult the documentation for the repository type that the snapshot policy is using. Refer to the [guide on managing repositories in ECE](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/cloud-enterprise.md) if you are using an Elastic Cloud Enterprise deployment.

One common failure scenario is repository corruption. This occurs most often when multiple instances of {{es}} write to the same repository location. There is a [separate troubleshooting guide](diagnosing-corrupted-repositories.md) to fix this problem.

If snapshots are failing for other reasons check the logs on the elected master node during the snapshot execution period for more information.
