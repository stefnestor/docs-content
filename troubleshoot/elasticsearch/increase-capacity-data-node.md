# Increase the disk capacity of data nodes [increase-capacity-data-node]

Disk capacity pressures may cause index failures, unassigned shards, and cluster instability. 

{{es}} uses [disk-based shard allocation watermarks](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/cluster-level-shard-allocation-routing-settings.md#disk-based-shard-allocation) to manage disk space on nodes, which can block allocation or indexing when nodes run low on disk space. Refer to [](/troubleshoot/elasticsearch/fix-watermark-errors.md) for additional details on how to address this situation.

To increase the disk capacity of the data nodes in your cluster, complete these steps:

1. [Estimate how much disk capacity you need](#estimate-required-capacity).
1. [Increase the disk capacity](#increase-disk-capacity-of-data-nodes).


## Estimate the amount of required disk capacity [estimate-required-capacity]

The following steps explain how to retrieve the current disk watermark configuration of the cluster and how to check the current disk usage on the nodes.

1. Retrieve the relevant disk thresholds that indicate how much space should be available. The relevant thresholds are the [high watermark](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/cluster-level-shard-allocation-routing-settings.md#cluster-routing-watermark-high) for all the tiers apart from the frozen one and the [frozen flood stage watermark](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/cluster-level-shard-allocation-routing-settings.md#cluster-routing-flood-stage-frozen) for the frozen tier. The following example demonstrates disk shortage in the hot tier, so only the high watermark is retrieved:

    ```console
    GET _cluster/settings?include_defaults&filter_path=*.cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high*
    ```

    The response looks like this:

    ```console-result
    {
      "defaults": {
        "cluster": {
          "routing": {
            "allocation": {
              "disk": {
                "watermark": {
                  "high": "90%",
                  "high.max_headroom": "150GB"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The above means that in order to resolve the disk shortage, disk usage must drop below the 90% or have more than 150GB available. Read more on how this threshold works [here](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/cluster-level-shard-allocation-routing-settings.md#cluster-routing-watermark-high).

1. Find the current disk usage, which in turn indicates how much extra space is required. For simplicity, our example has one node, but you can apply the same for every node over the relevant threshold.

    ```console
    GET _cat/allocation?v&s=disk.avail&h=node,disk.percent,disk.avail,disk.total,disk.used,disk.indices,shards
    ```

    The response looks like this:

    ```console-result
    node                disk.percent disk.avail disk.total disk.used disk.indices shards
    instance-0000000000           91     4.6gb       35gb    31.1gb       29.9gb    111
    ```

In this scenario, the high watermark configuration indicates that the disk usage needs to drop below 90%, while the current disk usage is 91%.


## Increase the disk capacity of your data nodes [increase-disk-capacity-of-data-nodes]

Here are the most common ways to increase disk capacity:

* You can expand the disk space of the existing nodes. This is typically achieved by replacing your nodes with ones with higher capacity.
* You can add additional data nodes to the data tier that is short of disk space, increasing the overall capacity of that tier and potentially improving performance by distributing data and workload across more resources.

When you add another data node, the cluster doesn't recover immediately and it might take some time until shards are relocated to the new node. 
You can check the progress with the following API call:

```console
GET /_cat/shards?v&h=state,node&s=state
```

If in the response the shards' state is `RELOCATING`, it means that shards are still moving. Wait until all shards turn to `STARTED`.

:::{warning}
:applies_to: ece:
In ECE, resizing is limited by your [allocator capacity](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/ece-manage-capacity.md).
:::

To increase the disk capacity of the data nodes in your cluster:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) or ECE Cloud UI.
1. On the home page, find your deployment and select **Manage**.
1. Go to **Actions** > **Edit deployment** and check that autoscaling is enabled. Adjust the **Enable Autoscaling for** dropdown menu as needed and select **Save**.
1. If autoscaling is successful, the cluster returns to a `healthy` status.
If the cluster is still out of disk, check if autoscaling has reached its set limits and [update your autoscaling settings](/deploy-manage/autoscaling/autoscaling-in-ece-and-ech.md#ec-autoscaling-update).

You can also add more capacity by adding more nodes to your cluster and targeting the data tier that may be short of disk. For more information, refer to [](/troubleshoot/elasticsearch/add-tier.md).

::::::{applies-item} { self: }
To increase the data node capacity in your cluster, you can [add more nodes](/deploy-manage/maintenance/add-and-remove-elasticsearch-nodes.md) to the cluster, or increase the disk capacity of existing nodes. Disk expansion procedures depend on your operating system and storage infrastructure and are outside the scope of Elastic support. In practice, this is often achieved by [removing a node from the cluster](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-remove-node) and reinstalling it with a larger disk.

To increase the disk capacity of data nodes in your {{eck}} cluster, you can either add more data nodes or increase the storage size of existing nodes.

**Option 1: Add more data nodes**

1. Update the `count` field in your data node NodeSet to add more nodes:

    ```yaml subs=true
    apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
    kind: Elasticsearch
    metadata:
      name: quickstart
    spec:
      version: {{version.stack}}
      nodeSets:
      - name: data-nodes
        count: 5  # Increase from previous count
        config:
          node.roles: ["data"]
        volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
            name: elasticsearch-data
          spec:
            accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 100Gi
    ```

1. Apply the changes:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f your-elasticsearch-manifest.yaml
    ```

    ECK automatically creates the new nodes and {{es}} will relocate shards to balance the load. You can monitor the progress using:

    ```console
    GET /_cat/shards?v&h=state,node&s=state
    ```

**Option 2: Increase storage size of existing nodes**

1. If your storage class supports [volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims), you can increase the storage size in the `volumeClaimTemplates`:

    ```yaml subs=true
    apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
    kind: Elasticsearch
    metadata:
      name: quickstart
    spec:
      version: {{version.stack}}
      nodeSets:
      - name: data-nodes
        count: 3
        config:
          node.roles: ["data"]
        volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
            name: elasticsearch-data
          spec:
            accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 200Gi  # Increased from previous size
    ```

1. Apply the changes. If the volume driver supports `ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes`, the filesystem will be resized online without restarting {{es}}. Otherwise, you may need to manually delete the Pods after the resize so they can be recreated with the expanded filesystem.

For more information, refer to [](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/update-deployments.md) and [](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/volume-claim-templates.md).
