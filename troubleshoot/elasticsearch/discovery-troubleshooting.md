# Troubleshoot discovery [discovery-troubleshooting]

Usually, the [discovery and election](/deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/discovery-cluster-formation.md) process completes quickly, and the master node remains elected for a long period of time.

If your cluster doesn't have a stable master, many of its features don't work correctly and {{es}} reports errors to clients and in its logs. You must fix the master node's instability before addressing these other issues. It isn't possible to solve any other issues while there is no elected master node or the elected master node is unstable.

If your cluster has a stable master but some nodes can't discover or join it, these nodes report errors to clients and in their logs. You must address the obstacles preventing these nodes from joining the cluster before addressing other issues. It isn't possible to solve any other issues reported by these nodes while they are unable to join the cluster.

If the cluster has no elected master node for more than a few seconds, the master is unstable, or some nodes are unable to discover or join a stable master, then {{es}} records information in its logs explaining why. If the problems persist for more than a few minutes, {{es}} records additional information in its logs. To properly troubleshoot discovery and election problems, collect and analyze logs covering at least five minutes from all nodes.

The following sections describe some common discovery and election problems.

:::{tip}
:applies_to: ece:, ech:, eck:
The discovery and master election processes described here apply to all {{es}} clusters, including those managed by Elastic's orchestration platforms. While you might not configure discovery settings directly in ECE, ECK, or ECH, the underlying behavior and troubleshooting steps remain the same.

For managed deployments:

* Use your platform's tools to collect logs from all master-eligible nodes.
% list of tools here would be nice
* Network and resource issues might occur within the orchestration layer. Investigate using your platform's monitoring and diagnostics features.
* If infrastructure-level problems are suspected, contact your platform administrator or Elastic Support.

## No master is elected [discovery-no-master]

When a node wins the master election, it logs a message containing `elected-as-master` and all nodes log a message containing `master node changed` identifying the new elected master node.

If there is no elected master node and no node can win an election, all nodes repeatedly log messages about the problem using a logger called `org.elasticsearch.cluster.coordination.ClusterFormationFailureHelper`. By default, this happens every 10 seconds.

Master elections only involve master-eligible nodes, so focus your attention on the master-eligible nodes in this situation. These nodes' logs indicate the requirements for a master election, such as the discovery of a certain set of nodes. The [Health](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-health-report) API on these nodes also provides useful information about the situation.

If the logs or the health report indicate that {{es}} can't discover enough nodes to form a quorum, you must address the reasons preventing {{es}} from discovering the missing nodes. The missing nodes are needed to reconstruct the cluster metadata. Without the cluster metadata, the data in your cluster is meaningless. The cluster metadata is stored on a subset of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster. If a quorum can't be discovered, the missing nodes were the ones holding the cluster metadata.

Ensure there are enough nodes running to form a quorum and that every node can communicate with every other node over the network. {{es}} reports additional details about network connectivity if the election problems persist for more than a few minutes. If you can't start enough nodes to form a quorum, start a new cluster and restore data from a recent snapshot. Refer to [Quorum-based decision making](../../deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/discovery-cluster-formation/modules-discovery-quorums.md) for more information.

If the logs or the health report indicate that {{es}} *has* discovered a possible quorum of nodes, the typical reason that the cluster can't elect a master is that one of the other nodes can't discover a quorum. Inspect the logs on the other master-eligible nodes and ensure that they have all discovered enough nodes to form a quorum.

If the logs suggest that discovery or master elections are failing due to timeouts or network-related issues, refer to [Investigate timeout and network issues](#investigate-timeout-and-network-issues).


## Master is elected but unstable [discovery-master-unstable]

When a node wins the master election, it logs a message containing `elected-as-master`. If this happens repeatedly, the elected master node is unstable. In this situation, focus on the logs from the master-eligible nodes to understand why the election winner stops being the master and triggers another election.

If the logs suggest that the master is unstable due to timeouts or network-related issues, refer to [Investigate timeout and network issues](#investigate-timeout-and-network-issues).


## Node cannot discover or join stable master [discovery-cannot-join-master]

If there is a stable elected master but a node can't discover or join its cluster, it repeatedly logs messages about the problem using the `ClusterFormationFailureHelper` logger. The [Health](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-health-report) API on the affected node also provides useful information about the situation. Other log messages on the affected node and the elected master might provide additional information about the problem.

If the logs suggest that the node cannot discover or join the cluster due to timeouts or network-related issues, refer to [Investigate timeout and network issues](#investigate-timeout-and-network-issues).


## Node joins cluster and leaves again [discovery-node-leaves]

If a node joins the cluster but {{es}} determines it to be faulty, it is removed from the cluster again. Refer to [Troubleshooting an unstable cluster](../../deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/discovery-cluster-formation/cluster-fault-detection.md#cluster-fault-detection-troubleshooting) for more information.


## Investigate timeout and network issues [investigate-timeout-and-network-issues]

If logs suggest that discovery, master elections, or cluster joining are failing due to timeouts or network-related issues, narrow down the problem using the following approaches:

* **GC pauses**: GC pauses are recorded in the GC logs that {{es}} emits by default, and also usually by the `JvmMonitorService` in the main node logs. Use these logs to confirm whether the node is experiencing high heap usage with long GC pauses. If so, [the troubleshooting guide for high heap usage](high-jvm-memory-pressure.md) has some suggestions for further investigation, but typically you need to capture a heap dump and the [garbage collector logs](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/jvm-settings.md#gc-logging) during a time of high heap usage to fully understand the problem.

* **VM pauses**: VM pauses also affect other processes on the same host. A VM pause also typically causes a discontinuity in the system clock, which {{es}} reports in its logs. If you notice evidence of other processes pausing at the same time, or unexpected clock discontinuities, investigate the infrastructure on which you are running {{es}}.

* **Packet captures**: Packet captures reveal system-level and network-level faults, especially if you capture the network traffic simultaneously at all relevant nodes and analyze it alongside the {{es}} logs from those nodes. You should be able to observe any retransmissions, packet loss, or other delays on the connections between the nodes.

* **Long thread waits**: Long waits for particular threads to be available can be identified by taking stack dumps of the main {{es}} process (for example, using `jstack`) or a profiling trace (for example, using Java Flight Recorder) in the few seconds leading up to the relevant log message.

    The [Nodes hot threads](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-hot-threads) API sometimes yields useful information, but bear in mind that this API also requires a number of `transport_worker` and `generic` threads across all the nodes in the cluster. The API may be affected by the very problem you're trying to diagnose. `jstack` is much more reliable since it doesn't require any JVM threads.

    The threads involved in discovery and cluster membership are mainly `transport_worker` and `cluster_coordination` threads, for which there should never be a long wait. There may also be evidence of long waits for threads in the {{es}} logs, particularly looking at warning logs from `org.elasticsearch.transport.InboundHandler`. Refer to [Networking threading model](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/networking-settings.md#modules-network-threading-model) for more information.
