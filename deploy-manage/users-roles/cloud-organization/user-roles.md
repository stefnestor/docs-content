# User roles and privileges [ec-user-privileges]
$$$general-assign-user-roles$$$

Within an {{ecloud}} organization, users can have one or more roles and each role grants specific privileges.

You can assign user roles when you [invite users to join your organization](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md#ec-invite-users). You can also edit the roles assigned to a user later.

On this page, you'll learn the following:

* [How to edit a user's roles](#edit-a-users-roles)
* The [types of roles](#types-of-roles) available, the levels where they can be applied, and the [scope](#ec-role-scoping) of each role type
* The predefined roles available for [{{ech}}](#ech-predefined-roles) and [{{serverless-full}}](#general-assign-user-roles-table)

## Edit a user's roles

To edit the roles assigned to a user:

1. Log in to [{{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. From the navigation menu, select **Organization** > **Members**.
4. Select the user on the **Members** tab of the **Organization** page.
5. Click **Edit** to change the user's roles.

## Types of roles

There are two types of roles you can assign to users:

* **Organization-level roles:** These roles apply to the entire organization and are not specific to any serverless project or hosted deployment.
* **Cloud resource access roles:** These roles are specific to each serverless project or hosted deployment.

### Organization-level roles [ec_organization_level_roles]

* **Organization owner**: The role assigned by default to the user who created the organization. Organization owners have all privileges to {{ecloud}} resources including {{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects, as well as users, organization-level details and properties, billing details and subscription levels. They are also able to sign on to deployments with superuser privileges.
* **Billing admin**: Can manage an organization’s billing details such as credit card information, subscription and invoice history. Cannot manage other organization or deployment details and properties.

### Cloud resource access roles [ec_instance_access_roles]

You can set cloud resource access roles at two levels:

* **Globally**, for all {{ech}} deployments, or for all {{serverless-full}} projects of the same type ({{es-serverless}}, {{observability}}, or {{elastic-sec}}). In this case, the role will also apply to new deployments, or projects of the specified type type, created later.
* **Individually**, for specific deployments or projects only. To do that, you have to leave the **Role for all hosted deployments** field, or the **Role for all** for the project type, blank.

{{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects each have a set of predefined cloud resource access roles available:

* [{{ech}} predefined roles](#ech-predefined-roles)
* [{{serverless-full}} predefined roles](#general-assign-user-roles-table)

If you're using {{serverless-full}}, you can optionally [create custom roles in a project](/deploy-manage/users-roles/serverless-custom-roles.md). All custom roles grant the same access as the `Viewer` cloud resource access role with regards to {{ecloud}} privileges. To grant more {{ecloud}} privileges, assign more roles. Users receive a union of all their roles' privileges. To assign a custom role to users, go to **Cloud resource access** and select it from the list under the specific project it was created in.

## {{ech}} predefined roles [ech-predefined-roles]

For {{ech}} deployments, the following predefined roles are available. Each role defines what users can do in the {{ecloud}} console for deployment management and within the deployment for access to {{kib}} and data.

Roles can be scoped to specific deployments or to all deployments.

| Role name | {{ecloud}} access | Deployment access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | Manage deployment details, properties, and security privileges within their scope | [`superuser` built-in {{es}} role](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md#built-in-roles-superuser), which grants full access to {{kib}}, cluster management, and all data indices | Only Admins scoped to all deployments can create new deployments |
| **Editor** | Manage deployment details and properties within their scope, but cannot create new deployments or manage security | [`editor` built-in {{es}} role](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md#built-in-roles-editor), which grants full access to {{kib}} features and read-only access to user data indices | Some {{es}} HTTP APIs are not available due to limited cluster privileges, such as `GET _cat/indices` |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to deployments within their scope | [`viewer` built-in {{es}} role](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md#built-in-roles-viewer), which grants read-only access to {{kib}} features and user data indices | |

### Mapping of {{ecloud}} roles with {{stack}} roles [ec-stack-user-org-member]

There are two ways for a user to access {{kib}} instances of an {{ech}} deployment:

* **[Directly with {{es}} credentials](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth.md)**. In this case, users and their roles are managed directly in {{kib}}. Users in this case don’t need to be members of the {{ecloud}} organization to access the deployment. If you have several deployments, you need to manage users for each of them, individually.
* **Through your {{ecloud}} organization**. In this case, users who are members of your organization log in to {{ecloud}} and can open the deployments they have access to. Their access level is determined by the roles assigned to them from the **Organization** page. {{ecloud}} roles are mapped to [{{stack}} roles](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md) on a per-deployment level. When logging in to a specific deployment, users get the stack role that maps to their {{ecloud}} role for that particular deployment.

The following table shows the default mapping:

| Cloud role | Cloud API `role_id` | Stack role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organization owner | `organization-admin` | superuser |
| Billing admin | `billing-admin` | none |
| Admin | `deployment-admin` | superuser |
| Editor | `deployment-editor` | editor |
| Viewer | `deployment-viewer` | viewer |

## {{serverless-full}} predefined roles [general-assign-user-roles-table]

You can apply the following predefined roles to {{serverless-full}} projects. Some roles are only available to certain project types.

In the following table, the privileges outlined in **Project access** require [**Cloud Console, {{es}}, and {{kib}}** access](#access) to be granted for the relevant projects.

:::{tip}
You can optionally [create custom roles in a project](/deploy-manage/users-roles/serverless-custom-roles.md) and apply them to your organization users.

## Role scopes [ec-role-scoping]

Roles are assigned to every member of an organization and can refer (or be scoped) to one or more specific deployments, or all deployments. When a role is scoped to all deployments it grants permissions on all existing and future deployments.

This list describes the scope of the different roles:

* **Organization owner**: This role is always scoped to administer all deployments.
* **Billing admin**: This role does not refer to any deployment.
* **Cloud resource access roles**, including **Admin**: These roles can be scoped to either all deployments or projects, or specific deployments, project types, or projects.

Members are only able to see the role assignments of other members under the organization they belong to, for role assignments they are able to manage. Members with the **Organization owner** role assigned are able to see the role assignments of every member of their organization.

Members with the **Admin** role assigned are able to see role assignments for deployments or projects within their scope. For example, admins of all deployments and projects are able to see role assignments scoped to all and specific deployments and projects in the organization, while admins of specific deployments or projects only see role assignments scoped to those specific deployments or projects. This ensures that members assigned to specific deployments or projects do not try to remove role assignments from other members, and that the existence of other deployments or projects are not revealed to these members.

## Access options [access]
```{applies_to}
serverless: ga
```
When you grant **Organization owner** access, or **Cloud resource** access for one or more {{serverless-short}} projects, you can select the surfaces the user can access:

| Access | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloud Console, {{es}}, and {{kib}}** (default) | Grants access to the {{ecloud}} Console, plus the {{kib}} interface and {{es}} service for the applicable projects. |
| **Cloud Console** | Grants access to only the {{ecloud}} Console for the applicable {{serverless-short}} projects. |

### Considerations

The **Access** selection impacts the behavior of the selected role. Most roles require **Cloud Console, {{es}}, and {{kib}}** access to take full effect. However, you might choose to only grant **Cloud Console** access if the user does not need to interact with the project directly.

When **Cloud Console, {{es}}, and {{kib}}** access is not granted, roles that are designed to work inside of the project have limited access, and can't open the project in {{kib}}. For example: 

* If you select the **Admin** role, the user is able configure project settings and network security in {{ecloud}}, but can't log in to the relevant projects as superuser.
* Several predefined roles that are intended for project users, such as the Security **Tier 1 analyst** role, can view the relevant projects on the {{ecloud}} Console home page, but can't open the project to view their dashboards and visualizations.
* [Custom roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/serverless-custom-roles.md) always require **Cloud Console, {{es}}, and {{kib}}** access. Without it, users have only **Viewer** access in the {{ecloud}} Console, and can't log in to the project.

{applies_to}`serverless: preview` If your organization uses [{{cps}}](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config.md), the roles assigned to a user determine what data they can access across linked projects. Users can only see data from a linked project if their role on that project grants the necessary privileges. Refer to [Manage user access](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-access-and-scope.md#manage-user-and-api-key-access).

For details on the permissions granted for each role, refer to the [predefined roles table](#general-assign-user-roles-table).

:::{tip}
When inviting a user to your organization with the {{ecloud}} API, you can set their access surfaces in the invitation request. To grant {{ecloud}} Console-only access, pass an empty `application_id` array in the role assignment. For an example, refer to [Manage users](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md#ec-api-organizations).
