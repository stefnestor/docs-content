# Native users [ece-add-native-users]

If you are adding a small number of users and don’t mind managing them manually, using native authentication might be the best fit for your team.

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. Go to **Users** and then **Native users**.
3. Select **Create user**.
4. Provide the user details, select the [role](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-enterprise-orchestrator/manage-users-roles.md#ece-user-role-permissions), and set their password.

    The password must be a minimum of eight characters.

5. Save your changes. You might also want to verify their access with the credentials you created.
