## Agent Builder Executions [{{abb-anchor}}]

{{abb-preamble}}

Each execution represents one conversational turn — a user input and the agent's non-error response. Complex turns that exceed 50,000 input tokens count as additional executions to reflect the heavier processing involved. For example, a turn that uses 120,000 input tokens would count for 3 Agent Executions. Error responses are not billed. When an agent triggers a workflow as part of its response, the workflow execution is metered separately under Workflow Executions.

A free allocation of {{abb-free-executions}} executions per month is included. Volume tier reductions apply at higher usage levels. Refer to the [{{abb-pricing-label}}]({{abb-pricing-url}}) for specific rates and tier breakpoints.
