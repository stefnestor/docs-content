# Monitor and analyze usage

Information about your current {{ecloud}} subscription usage is available directly from the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) and includes:

* Monitor usage for the current month, including month-to-date usage
* For customers with annual prepaid credits, the total value of credits to be applied in the current billing cycle
* Check the usage breakdown for a selected time range
* View usage totals by product


You can check the detailed usage for a selected time range grouped either by product or by instance.

To access your account usage:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. From a deployment or project on the home page, select **Manage**.
3. From the lower navigation menu, select **Billing and Subscription**.
4. Go to the **Usage** page.

::::{important}
The usage breakdown information visible on the **Usage** page is an estimate, and does not include prepaid credits, free allowances or any discounts. To get the exact amount you owe for a given month, check your invoices in the [billing history](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/view-billing-history.md).
