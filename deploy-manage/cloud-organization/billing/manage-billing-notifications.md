# Manage usage and cost notifications [billing-notifications]

To help you to better understand your costs and manage spending on {{ecloud}}, you can configure email alerts to be sent when your monthly usage reaches a specified threshold, relative to a budget that you define for your account. You can also opt to receive a biweekly summary of your organization's usage and estimated costs for the previous month.

When configured, any email notifications are sent to users who are members of the Organization owner or Billing admin [user role](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md#ec_organization_level_roles).

To configure email notifications for your {{ecloud}} billing:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. From a deployment or project on the home page, select **Manage**.
3. From the lower navigation menu, select **Billing and subscription**.
4. Follow the steps in [Configure budget emails](#configure-budget-emails) to set up the email notifications you'd like to receive.

Note that [Credit consumption emails](#configure-credit-consumption-emails) are also shown on the **Billing and subscription** page, but these notifications are not configurable.

## Configure budget emails [configure-budget-emails]

Budget alerts can be sent when your organization's total monthly usage exceeds a threshold defined in a configurable budget.

To create a budget and configure budget emails:

1. Open the **Budgets and notifications** page.
2. Select **Add budget** to specify your budget details:
    1. Give your budget a name.
    1. Specify a target value in [Elastic Consumption Units](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/ecu.md) (ECU). The amount you spend is tracked against this target.
    
    The budget scope is automatically fixed to your entire {{ecloud}} organization. Alert emails are configured automatically based on the configured budget:
     - A warning email is sent when the organization's usage reaches 75% of the specified target amount.
     - An overage email is sent when the organization's usage reaches 100% of the specified target amount.

1. Click **Create budget** to confirm your settings.
1. Enable **Budget email**.

After creating a budget, you can navigate to the **Budgets and notifications** page at any time to view or update it, and to access the used versus total remaining ECU in your organization's budget.

## Credit consumption emails [configure-credit-consumption-emails]

Credit consumption alerts are sent when your organization has used a certain percentage of [available credits](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/ecu.md#view-available-credits). These alerts are set automatically and can't be configured.

Alerts are triggered to be sent when your credit consumption reaches one of the set thresholds: 33%, 25%, and 16% of active credits remaining.
