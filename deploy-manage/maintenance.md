This section outlines the key tasks and processes required to maintain a healthy, performant, and secure {{es}} infrastructure and its deployments.

The topics covered include:

* **[](maintenance/ece.md)**: Explains the procedures for maintaining both the host infrastructure and {{es}} deployments within Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).
* **[](maintenance/start-stop-services.md)**: Provides step-by-step instructions on how to safely start and stop your {{es}} deployment or {{kib}} instance, particularly when performing actions that require a restart.
* **[](maintenance/start-stop-routing-requests.md)**: Start or stop routing requests to an {{ech}} or {{ece}} deployment, or to all instances on an allocator in {{ece}}.
* **[](maintenance/add-and-remove-elasticsearch-nodes.md)**: Guides you through the process of enrolling new nodes or safely removing existing ones from a self-managed {{es}} cluster to optimize resource utilization and cluster performance.
