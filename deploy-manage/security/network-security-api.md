# Manage network security through the API

This example demonstrates how to use the {{ecloud}} RESTful API, {{ece}} RESTful API, or {{serverless-full}} RESTful API or to manage different types of network security policies and rules. 

We cover the following examples:

* [Create an IP filter policy or IP filtering rule set](#create-ip-filter-policy)

  * [Ingress](#ip-filter-policy-ingress)
  * [Egress](#ip-filter-policy-egress) {applies_to}`ess: beta`
  
* [Create a private connection policy](#private-connection) {applies_to}`ess:`
  * [AWS Privatelink](#private-connection-policy-aws)
  * [Azure Private Link](#private-connection-policy-azure)
  * [GCP Private Service Connect](#private-connection-policy-gcp)

* [Update a policy or rule set](#update-policy-rs)
* [Associate a policy or rule set with a project or deployment](#associate-policy-rs-with-deployment)
* [Remove a policy or rule set from a project or deployment](#delete-policy-rs-association-with-deployment)
* [Delete a policy or rule set](#delete-policy-rs)

Refer to [](network-security.md) to learn more about network security across all deployment types.

:::{tip}
Policies in {{ecloud}} are the equivalent of rule sets in {{ece}} and the {{ecloud}} API.
:::

## API reference

To learn more about these endpoints, refer to the reference for your deployment type:

* [{{ecloud}} API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud/group/endpoint-deploymentstrafficfilter)
* [{{ece}} API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud-enterprise/group/endpoint-deploymentstrafficfilter)


## Terminology in the {{ecloud}} console and APIs
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess:
serverless:
```

In {{ecloud}}, terminology related to network security has changed to more accurately reflect functionality. Terminology in the related APIs has not yet been updated.

| {{ecloud}} concept | API terminology | 
| --- | --- | 
| Network security | Traffic filters | 
| Network security policy | Traffic filter |
| IP filter policy | IP filtering rule set | 
| IP filter source | IP filter rule | 
| Private connection policy | Private link traffic filter |
| VPC filter | Private link filter rule |

## Create an IP filter policy or IP filtering rule set [create-ip-filter-policy]

IP filter policies in {{ecloud}} are the equivalent of IP filtering rule sets in {{ece}}.

Both policies and rule sets consist of multiple unique entries, each representing a source IP address or CIDR range. In {{ecloud}}, these entries are referred to as sources. In {{ece}} and the {{ecloud}} API, these entries are referred to as rules.

### Ingress [ip-filter-policy-ingress]

Send a request like the following to create an IP filter ingress policy or rule set:

::::{applies-switch}

:::{applies-item} serverless:

```json
curl \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/traffic-filters \
-d '
{
  "name": "My ingress IP filter policy",
  "region": "ap-southeast-1" <1>

  "type": "ip", <2>
  "rules": [
    {
      "description": "Allow inbound traffic from IP address 192.168.131.0",
      "source": "192.168.131.0"
    },
    {
      "description": "Allow inbound traffic within CIDR block 192.168.132.6/22",
      "source": "192.168.132.6/22"
    }
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'
```

1. The region is always the same region as the project you want to associate with an IP filter policy. For details, check the [list of available regions](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/regions.md).

2. The type of policy. In the JSON object, we use `ip` for IP filter policies. Currently, only `ip` is supported.

2. The type of policy. In the JSON object, we use `ip` for IP filter policies. Currently, we support `ip`, `egress_firewall`, `vpce` (AWS Private Link), `azure_private_endpoint` and `gcp_private_service_connect_endpoint`. These are described in further detail below.
:::

:::{applies-item} ece:

:::
::::

If the request is successful, a response containing an ID for the policy or rule set is returned. This ID is required to update or delete the policy or rule set itself, or it can be used to associate the policy or rule set to a deployment or project. It is referred to as `$POLICY_ID` or `$RULESET_ID` in the following examples.

```json
{
  "id" : "5470a0010ebf437bb9294ea9fcba0ba0"
}

           "protocol": "all"
       }
    },
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'
```

1. This can be `udp`, `tcp`, or `all`.


## Create a private connection policy [private-connection]
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess:
```

Learn how to create a private connection policy using the {{ecloud}} API. In the API, a VPC filter in a private connection policy is referred to as a rule.

:::{tip}
Private connection policies are optional for AWS PrivateLink and GCP Private Service Connect. After the VPC endpoint and DNS record are created, private connectivity is established.

Creating a private connection policy and associating it with your deployments allows you to do the following:

* Record that you've established private connectivity between the cloud service provider and Elastic in the applicable region.
* [View a list of the resources](network-security-policies.md#protected-resources-overview) that have private connections applied.
* Filter traffic to your deployment using VPC filters.

A private connection policy is required to establish a private connection with Azure Private Link.
