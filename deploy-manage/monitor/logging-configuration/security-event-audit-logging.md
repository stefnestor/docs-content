# Security event audit logging

% What needs to be done: Write from scratch

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/350

% Scope notes: Landing page about audit logs in Kibana and Elasticsearch, explaining how they can be enabled and configured, and also linking to the page about correlating information. We can create a doc to explain how to enable audit logging in both Elasticsearch and Kibana, and considering also ECE and orchestrated deployments. Kibana audit events list should be moved to reference content.

⚠️ **This page is a work in progress.** ⚠️
