:::{note}
If your organization uses firewalls, you need to provide access to port 443 and allow the agent to send data to the following URLs:
* `https://api.elastic-cloud.com`
* `https://otel-collector.auto-ops.${region}.${csp}.cloud.elastic.co/`

    Replace `${region}` and `${csp}` with the region and cloud service provider you have selected as your [storage location](../autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#storage-location). For example:

    `https://otel-collector.auto-ops.us-east-1.aws.cloud.elastic.co/`
