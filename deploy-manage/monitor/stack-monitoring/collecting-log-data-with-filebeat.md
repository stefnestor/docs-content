# Collecting log data with Filebeat [configuring-filebeat]


You can use {{filebeat}} to monitor the {{es}} log files, collect log events, and ship them to the monitoring cluster. Your recent logs are visible on the **Monitoring** page in {{kib}}.

::::{important}
If you’re using {{agent}}, do not deploy {{filebeat}} for log collection. Instead, configure the {{es}} integration to collect logs.
::::


1. Verify that {{es}} is running and that the monitoring cluster is ready to receive data from {{filebeat}}.

    ::::{tip}
    In production environments, we strongly recommend using a separate cluster (referred to as the *monitoring cluster*) to store the data. Using a separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster. 
    
    For more information, refer to [](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/es-self-monitoring-prod.md).
    ::::

2. Identify which logs you want to monitor.

    The {{filebeat}} {{es}} module can handle [audit logs](../../security/logging-configuration/logfile-audit-output.md), [deprecation logs](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/elasticsearch-deprecation-logs.md), [gc logs](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/jvm-settings.md#gc-logging), [server logs](../logging-configuration/elasticsearch-log4j-configuration-self-managed.md), and [slow logs](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/slow-logs.md). For more information about the location of your {{es}} logs, refer to the [path.logs](../../deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) setting.

    ::::{important}
    If there are both structured (`*.json`) and unstructured (plain text) versions of the logs, you must use the structured logs. Otherwise, they might not appear in the appropriate context in {{kib}}.
    ::::

3. [Install {{filebeat}}](beats://reference/filebeat/filebeat-installation-configuration.md) on the {{es}} nodes that contain logs that you want to monitor.
4. Identify where to send the log data.

    For example, specify {{es}} output information for your monitoring cluster in the {{filebeat}} configuration file (`filebeat.yml`):

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
      # Array of hosts to connect to.
      hosts: ["<ES_MONITORING_HOST1_URL>:9200", "<ES_MONITORING_HOST2_URL>:9200"] <1>

      # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
      #protocol: "https"
      #username: "elastic"
      #password: "changeme"
    ```

    1. In this example, the data is stored on a monitoring cluster with nodes `es-mon-1` and `es-mon-2`.


    If you configured the monitoring cluster to use encrypted communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting like `https://es-mon-1:9200`.

    ::::{important}
    The {{es}} {{monitor-features}} use ingest pipelines, therefore the cluster that stores the monitoring data must have at least one [ingest node](../../../manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md).
    ::::


    If {{es}} {{security-features}} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, you must provide a valid user ID and password so that {{filebeat}} can send metrics successfully.

    For more information about these configuration options, see [Configure the {{es}} output](beats://reference/filebeat/elasticsearch-output.md).

5. Optional: Identify where to visualize the data.

    {{filebeat}} provides example {{kib}} dashboards, visualizations and searches. To load the dashboards into the appropriate {{kib}} instance, specify the `setup.kibana` information in the {{filebeat}} configuration file (`filebeat.yml`) on each node:

    ```yaml
    setup.kibana:
      host: "localhost:5601"
      #username: "my_kibana_user"
      #password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    ```

    ::::{tip}
    In production environments, we strongly recommend using a dedicated {{kib}} instance for your monitoring cluster.
    ::::


    If {{security-features}} are enabled, you must provide a valid user ID and password so that {{filebeat}} can connect to {{kib}}:

    1. Create a user on the monitoring cluster that has the [`kibana_admin` built-in role](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md#built-in-roles-kibana-admin) or equivalent privileges.
    2. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the {{es}} output information in the {{filebeat}} configuration file. The example shows a hard-coded password, but you should store sensitive values in the [secrets keystore](beats://reference/filebeat/keystore.md).

    See [Configure the {{kib}} endpoint](beats://reference/filebeat/setup-kibana-endpoint.md).

6. Enable the {{es}} module and set up the initial {{filebeat}} environment on each node.

    For example:

    ```sh
    filebeat modules enable elasticsearch
    filebeat setup -e
    ```

    For more information, see [{{es}} module](beats://reference/filebeat/filebeat-module-elasticsearch.md).

7. Configure the {{es}} module in {{filebeat}} on each node.

    If the logs that you want to monitor aren’t in the default location, set the appropriate path variables in the `modules.d/elasticsearch.yml` file. See [Configure the {{es}} module](beats://reference/filebeat/filebeat-module-elasticsearch.md#configuring-elasticsearch-module).

    ::::{important}
    If there are JSON logs, configure the `var.paths` settings to point to them instead of the plain text logs.
    ::::

8. [Start {{filebeat}}](beats://reference/filebeat/filebeat-starting.md) on each node.

    ::::{note}
    Depending on how you’ve installed {{filebeat}}, you might see errors related to file ownership or permissions when you try to run {{filebeat}} modules. See [Config file ownership and permissions](beats://reference/libbeat/config-file-permissions.md).
    ::::

9. Check whether the appropriate indices exist on the monitoring cluster.

    For example, use the [cat indices](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-indices) command to verify that there are new `filebeat-*` indices.

    ::::{tip}
    If you want to use the **Monitoring** UI in {{kib}}, there must also be `.monitoring-*` indices. Those indices are generated when you collect metrics about {{stack}} products. For example, see [Collecting monitoring data with {{metricbeat}}](collecting-monitoring-data-with-metricbeat.md).
    ::::

10. [View the monitoring data in {{kib}}](kibana-monitoring-data.md).
