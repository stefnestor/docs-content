% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/350

% Scope notes: Merge both docs into 1 as an overview. Ensure its valid for all deployment types. Consider bringing part of the info from the elastic cloud monitoring introduction.

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/monitoring-overview.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/how-monitoring-works.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-monitoring.md

$$$ec-es-cluster-performance$$$

$$$ec-es-health-dedicated$$$

$$$ec-es-health-preconfigured$$$
