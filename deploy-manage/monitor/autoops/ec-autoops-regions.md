# AutoOps regions [ec-autoops-regions]

A region is the geographic area where the cloud provider’s data center that hosts your deployments is located. Based on a planned release schedule, Elastic is enabling the AutoOps service on the following cloud service providers: AWS, Azure, and GCP.

AutoOps is currently available in the following regions:

| Provider | Region | Name |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS | us-east-1 | US East (N. Virginia) |  |
| AWS | us-west-2 | Oregon |  |
| AWS | eu-west-1 | Ireland |  |

::::{note} 
Currently, a limited number of AWS regions are available. More regions for AWS, Azure and GCP will be added in the future. Also, AutoOps is currently not available for GovCloud customers.
