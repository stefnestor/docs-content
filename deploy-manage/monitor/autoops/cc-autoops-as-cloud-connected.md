# AutoOps for self-managed clusters

Use [AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) with your ECE ({{ece}}), ECK ({{eck}}), or self-managed clusters through [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md). 

Cloud Connect enables users of ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters to use {{ecloud}} services. This means you can take advantage of the simplified cluster monitoring, real-time issue detection, and performance recommendations of AutoOps without having to run and manage the underlying infrastructure.
