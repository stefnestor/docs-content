# Template Optimizer view in AutoOps [ec-autoops-template-optimizer]

The **Template Optimizer** view offers detailed recommendations for optimizing templates. When AutoOps identifies a recommended change, it logs the template separately, allowing you to track impactful changes over time. You can navigate between different deployments or clusters to view all template recommendations.

To get to the **Template Optimizer** view, go to AutoOps in your deployment or cluster and select **Template Optimizer** from the side navigation.
