## General AutoOps questions

$$$what-is-autoops$$$**What does AutoOps do?**
:   AutoOps for {{es}} simplifies cluster management by providing performance recommendations, resource utilization and cost insights, real-time issue detection, and resolution paths. By analyzing hundreds of {{es}} metrics, your configuration, and usage patterns, AutoOps provides operational and monitoring recommendations that reduce administration time and hardware costs.

$$$autoops-deployment-types$$$**Is AutoOps available in all deployment types?**
:   :::{include} /deploy-manage/monitor/_snippets/autoops-availability.md
::: 

$$$cant-see-autoops$$$**Why can't I see AutoOps in some deployments and projects?**
:   AutoOps is rolling out in phases across CSPs and [regions](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-regions.md), so you might not see it if your deployment or project is in a region where AutoOps is not available yet.

$$$autoops-license$$$**How is AutoOps licensed?**
:   AutoOps is available for free across all subscription levels and license types in {{ech}} deployments, {{serverless-short}} projects, and ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters. It does not consume ECUs.

$$$autoops-monitoring$$$**Does AutoOps monitor the entire {{stack}}?**
:   AutoOps is currently limited to {{es}} (not {{kib}}, Logstash, or Beats).

$$$autoops-issue-resolution$$$**Can AutoOps automatically resolve issues?**
:   AutoOps only analyzes metrics and is a read-only solution.

$$$autoops-supported-versions$$$**Which versions of {{es}} are supported in AutoOps for {{ech}} and ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters?**
:   AutoOps is compatible with [supported {{es}} versions](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) (7.17.x and above).

$$$autoops-data-retention$$$**How long does Elastic retain AutoOps data?**
:   AutoOps has a 10 day retention period.

$$$autoops-metrics-storage$$$**Where are AutoOps metrics stored, and does AutoOps affect customer ECU usage?**
:   AutoOps metrics are stored internally within the Elastic infrastructure, not on customer deployments. Using AutoOps does not consume customer ECU.

$$$autoops-vs-stack-monitoring$$$**Has AutoOps replaced Stack Monitoring?**
:   Currently, AutoOps has many of the same features as Stack Monitoring as well as several new ones. However, it only provides insights on {{es}} and analyzes metrics, not logs. Read more in [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops-vs-stack-monitoring.md).

$$$feedback$$$**How do I provide feedback about AutoOps?**
:   We value your feedback. Help us improve by posting in our [Slack community](https://elasticstack.slack.com/) or the [Monitoring category](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/monitoring/103) in the Elastic Discuss forum.

## Questions about AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters

$$$additional-payment$$$ **Does AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters incur additional costs?**
:   In ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters, AutoOps is available for free across all [self-managed license types](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) through [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md). This does not consume ECUs.

$$$autoops-metrics-cost$$$ **Does shipping metrics data to {{ecloud}} incur additional costs?**
:   Elastic does not charge extra for this service, but your cloud service provider (CSP) might. When sending metrics data from your cluster in a CSP region to {{ecloud}}, shipping costs are determined by your agreement with that CSP. 

    You can [choose the CSP region where your data is stored](#sm-autoops-metrics-storage).

$$$deployment-types$$$ **Which deployment types can be connected to AutoOps through Cloud Connect?**
:   You can connect to AutoOps on a standalone {{stack}}, ECE ({{ece}}), or ECK ({{eck}}) deployment, both on-premise and in private cloud environments.

$$$autoops-air-gapped$$$ **Can I use AutoOps if my environment is air-gapped?**
:   AutoOps is designed as a cloud service that needs an internet connection to send metrics to {{ecloud}}. However, you can make specific configuration choices to securely use it in your air-gapped environment:

    * **Exclude metrics**: AutoOps only collects [operational metrics](#extracted-info) from your cluster, not the underlying data. You can also choose to [disable the collection of certain types of metrics](../autoops/autoops-disable-metrics-collection.md) by AutoOps.  
    * **Minimize network exposure**: AutoOps does not require broad internet access. You can choose to only [give access to the required port and URLs](../autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#firewall-allowlist).  
    * **Inspect gathered data**: You can use the [`autoops_es_debug.yml` configuration file](#data-viewing-config) to view a sample of the data gathered from your cluster before it is sent to {{ecloud}}.

    A locally deployable version of AutoOps is planned for a future release.

$$$maintenance$$$ **Do I have to do any maintenance when using AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters?**
:   AutoOps is a cloud service, so you don't need to upgrade it yourself. However, there are two things to keep in mind:
* In general, {{agent}} can ship data from connected clusters on any [supported {{es}} version](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) (7.17.x and above). But we recommend keeping {{agent}} upgraded to the latest version for optimum performance and access to new features and fixes.
* When using the ECK installation method, make sure your instance of {{agent}} meets the [version requirements](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#prerequisites) for your license type.  

$$$trial-ending$$$ **I connected my ECE, ECK, or self-managed cluster to AutoOps during a free trial of {{ecloud}}. What happens after my trial ends?**
:   After your free trial ends, your cluster remains connected and AutoOps continues to process your {{es}} metrics as long as: 
* You have an [active {{ecloud}} account](../../cloud-organization/billing/add-billing-details.md).
* {{agent}} is running and shipping metrics to {{ecloud}}.

$$$support$$$ **What kind of support is available to me when using AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters?**
:   Support eligibility is determined by the license of your connected cluster:
* Platinum and Enterprise licenses: Eligible for [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/).
* Free and open (Basic) licenses: Eligible for community-based support through the [Elastic Stack Community on Slack](https://elasticstack.slack.com/) or the [Monitoring category](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/monitoring/103) in the Elastic Discuss forum.

### Setting up AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters

$$$macos-install$$$ **Can I use macOS to install {{agent}} to connect my ECE, ECK, or self-managed cluster to AutoOps?**
:   No, macOS is not a supported platform for installing {{agent}} and connecting an ECE, ECK, or self-managed cluster to AutoOps. Refer to [Install agent](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#install-agent) for a list of supported platforms. You can use macOS to [connect your local development cluster to AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-local-dev-to-autoops.md).

$$$elastic-ip-address$$$ **Do I have to define an Elastic IP address to enable the agent to send data to {{ecloud}}?**
:   You might need to define an IP address if your organization’s settings will block the agent from sending out data. 

    To enable IP ranges, {{ecloud}} offers a selection of static IP addresses. All traffic directed to {{ecloud}} deployments, whether originating from the public internet, your private cloud network through the public internet, or your on-premise network through the public internet utilizes Ingress Static IPs as the network destination. 

:   For more information, refer to [](/deploy-manage/security/elastic-cloud-static-ips.md).

$$$agent-nodes$$$ **Do I have to install {{agent}} separately for each node in my cluster?**
:    No, to run AutoOps in your ECE, ECK, or self-managed environment, you only have to install the agent once per cluster.

$$$connect-more-clusters$$$**Do I have to re-run the installation wizard to connect more clusters?**
:   Not necessarily. Refer to [Connect additional clusters](../autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#connect-additional-clusters) for more information.

### Collected metrics and data in AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters

$$$sm-autoops-metrics-storage$$$ **Where are metrics stored in AutoOps for ECE, ECK, or self-managed clusters?**
:   You can choose where to store your metrics from the following AWS regions:

    :::{include} ../_snippets/autoops-cc-regions.md
    :::

$$$extracted-info$$$ **What information does {{agent}} gather from my cluster?**
:   {{agent}} only extracts and sends cluster metrics to {{ecloud}}, not the underlying data within your cluster. The following metrics are collected:

    | API | Description | Collected data |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [_cat/shards](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-shards) | Returns detailed information about the shards within the cluster | Shard states, node allocation, index names, sizes, and replica information |
    | [_nodes/stats](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-stats) | Retrieves statistics from cluster nodes including JVM, OS, process, and transport metrics | CPU usage, memory utilization, thread pools, file system stats |
    | [_cluster/settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-get-settings) | Returns the settings configured for the cluster | Persistent and transient settings such as cluster-wide configurations |
    | [_cluster/health](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-health) | Provides information about the overall health of the cluster | Status (green/yellow/red), number of nodes, number of shards |
    | [_cat/template](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-templates) | Lists all index templates in the cluster | Template names, patterns, and basic settings |
    | [_index_template](/manage-data/data-store/templates.md) | Retrieves composable index templates | Index settings, mappings, and aliases |
    | [_component_template](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-get-component-template) | Fetches component templates used for building index templates | Metadata for re-usable mappings and settings |
    | [_tasks](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-tasks) | Displays information about currently running tasks on the cluster | Task descriptions, start times, running nodes, and execution details |
    | [_template](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-template) | Retrieves legacy index templates | Similar to composable index templates but in older format |
    | [_resolve/index/*](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-resolve-index) | Resolves index, data stream, and alias names to their current definitions | Mappings between names and underlying data objects |

$$$data-gathering$$$ **How does AutoOps gather data from my cluster and ensure its security?**
:   AutoOps gathers data from your cluster using two protocols:
    * **HTTP request**: Made to our Cloud Connected API to register your cluster with {{ecloud}} and gather registration-related data.
    * **OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)**: Used to gather all other operational data.

    Each channel is authenticated using an API key or token to ensure your data's security. The following table offers more details: 

    | Protocol | Data extracted | Port | Authentication method | 
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | HTTP |  Basic cluster information from the `/` endpoint <br><br> License information from the `/_license` endpoint | **443**: standard HTTPS port | Uses an {{ecloud}} API key which is limited for use with Cloud Connect only. |
    | OTLP over HTTP | Operational information | **443**: standard HTTPS port | Uses an AutoOps token which is functionally equivalent to an API key. |

$$$data-viewing-config$$$**Can I view the data gathered by {{agent}}?**
:   Yes. AutoOps {{agent}} comes bundled with the `autoops_es_debug.yml` configuration file, which you can use to view a sample of the data gathered from your cluster that would be sent to Elastic Cloud.

    Complete the following steps to view a sample of this data locally:

    1. Follow the steps to [connect to AutoOps](cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md) until you reach the [Install agent](cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#install-agent) step.
    2. In the **Install agent** step, edit the installation command to replace `autoops_es.yml` with `autoops_es_debug.yml` as shown in the following code block:
    ```json
        --config otel_samples/autoops_es_debug.yml \
    ```
    3. Run the command to start the container.
    4. The data sample will be logged to the container's standard output in JSON format. To view the output, run the following command:
    ```json
    docker logs autoops-otel-agent
    ```
