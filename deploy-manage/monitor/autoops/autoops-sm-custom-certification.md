# Configure AutoOps {{agent}} with a custom SSL certificate 

{{agent}} might not recognize your SSL certificate if it is signed by a custom or internal Certificate Authority (CA). In this case, {{agent}} will fail to connect your self-managed cluster to AutoOps and you might encounter an error like the following:

```sh
... x509: certificate signed by unknown authority ...
```

This error occurs because the machine where you have installed {{agent}} does not trust your custom or internal CA. To fix this error, follow the steps on this page to configure the agent with your custom SSL certificate.

## Add custom certificate path to the `elastic-agent.yml` file

To configure {{agent}} with your custom SSL certificate, add the path to your certificate to the [`elastic-agent.yml`](/reference/fleet/configure-standalone-elastic-agents.md) policy file on the host machine where the agent is installed. 

Complete the following steps:

1. On the host machine, open the `elastic-agent.yml` file. The default location is `/opt/Elastic/Agent/elastic-agent.yml`.
2. In the `elastic-agent.yml` file, locate the `receivers.metricbeatreceiver.metricbeat.modules` section. 
3. In this section, there are two modules configured for `autoops_es`, one for metrics and one for templates. \
  Add the `ss.certificate_authorities` setting to both these modules using one of the following options:

    :::::{tab-set}
    :group: add-cert-auth-setting-to-module

    ::::{tab-item} Use environment variable (recommended)
    :sync: env-variable

    We recommend using this method because it's flexible and keeps sensitive paths out of your main configuration.

    Add the following line to both `autoops_es` modules:

    ```yaml
    ssl.certificate_authorities:
      - ${env:AUTOOPS_CA_CERT}
    ```
    After adding this line to both modules, make sure the` AUTOOPS_CA_CERT` environment variable is set on the host machine and contains the full path to your certificate file (for example: `/etc/ssl/certs/my_internal_ca.crt`).
    ::::

    ::::{tab-item} Hardcode file path
    :sync: hardcode-file-path

    Use this method to specify the path directly. This method is often simpler for fixed or test environments.

    Edit the following line with the path to your CA and add it to both `autoops_es` modules:

    ```yaml
    ssl.certificate_authorities:
      - "/path/to/your/ca.crt"
    ```
    The following codeblock shows what your final configuration should look like when you use the hardcode method.

    ```yaml
    receivers:
      metricbeatreceiver:
        metricbeat:
          modules:
            # Metrics
            - module: autoops_es
              hosts: ${env:AUTOOPS_ES_URL}
              period: 10s
              metricsets:
                - cat_shards
                - cluster_health
                - cluster_settings
                - license
                - node_stats
                - tasks_management
              # --- ADD THIS LINE ---
              ssl.certificate_authorities:
                - "/path/to/your/ca.crt"

            # Templates
            - module: autoops_es
              hosts: ${env:AUTOOPS_ES_URL}
              period: 24h
              metricsets:
                - cat_template
                - component_template
                - index_template
              # --- ADD THIS LINE ---
              ssl.certificate_authorities:
                - "/path/to/your/ca.crt"
    ```

    ::::

    :::::

4. Save your changes to the `elastic-agent.yml` file.
5. Restart {{agent}} so that the new settings can take effect.\
    In most systemd-based Linux environments, you can use the following command to restart the agent:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart elastic-agent
    ```
6. Check the agent logs again to confirm that the error is gone and that {{agent}} has successfully connected your self-managed cluster to AutoOps. 

    :::{note}
    If you encounter the following error in the agent logs, there might be a formatting issue in the `elastic-agent.yml` file.
    ```sh
    ... can not convert 'object' into 'string' ... ssl.certificate_authorities ...
    ```
    To fix this error, ensure your configuration is correctly formatted. The `ss.certificate_authorities` setting must be a list item (indicated by the `-`) containing one or more strings (the respective path to your certification files).
