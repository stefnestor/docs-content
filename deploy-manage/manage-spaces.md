# Spaces [xpack-spaces]

**Spaces** let you organize your content and users according to your needs.

- Each space has its own saved objects.
- Users can access only the spaces that they have been granted access to. This access is based on user roles, and a given role can have different permissions per space.
- In {{stack}} deployments on version 8.16 and later, each space has its own navigation, called solution view.

{{kib}} creates a default space for you. When you create more spaces, users are asked to choose a space when they log in, and can change their current space at any time from the top menu.

You can find the **Spaces** management page in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

For more info on working with spaces, check out: 
- [Create a space](#spaces-managing)
- [Define access to a space](#spaces-control-user-access)
- [Move saved objects between spaces](#spaces-moving-objects)
- [Configure a space-level landing page](#spaces-default-route)
- [Delete a space](#_delete_a_space)

Check out [Using Spaces with Fleet](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces-fleet.md) for info on using spaces with {{fleet}} in a space-aware data model.

## Required permissions [_required_privileges_3]

* **Serverless projects:** `Admin` role or equivalent
* **{{stack}} deployments:** `kibana_admin` or equivalent


## Create a space [spaces-managing]

The maximum number of spaces that you can have differs by deployment type:

* **Serverless projects:** Maximum of 100 spaces.
* **{{stack}} deployments:** Controlled by the `xpack.spaces.maxSpaces` setting. Default is 1000. View the [full list of Space settings](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/spaces-settings.md).

To create a space:

:::::{tab-set}
:group: stack-serverless

::::{tab-item} {{serverless-short}}
:sync: serverless

1. Click **Create space** or select the space you want to edit.
2. Provide:

    * A meaningful name and description for the space.
    * A URL identifier. The URL identifier is a short text string that becomes part of the {{kib}} URL. {{kib}} suggests a URL identifier based on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking. You cannot change the space identifier later.

3. Customize the avatar of the space to your liking.
4. Save the space.
::::

::::{tab-item} {{stack}}
:sync: stack

1. Select **Create space** and provide a name, description, and URL identifier.
   The URL identifier is a short text string that becomes part of the {{kib}} URL when you are inside that space. {{kib}} suggests a URL identifier based on the name of your space, but you can customize the identifier to your liking. You cannot change the space identifier once you create the space.

2. Select a **Solution view**. This setting controls the navigation that all users of the space will get:
   * **Search**: A light navigation menu focused on analytics and Search use cases. Features specific to Observability and Security are hidden.
   * **Observability**: A light navigation menu focused on analytics and Observability use cases. Features specific to Search and Security are hidden.
   * **Security**: A light navigation menu focused on analytics and Security use cases. Features specific to Observability and Search are hidden.
   * **Classic**: All features from all solutions are visible by default using the classic, multilayered navigation menus. You can customize which features are visible individually.

3. If you selected the **Classic** solution view, you can customize the **Feature visibility** as you need it to be for that space.

   :::{note}
   Even when disabled in this menu, some Management features can remain visible to some users depending on their privileges. Additionally, controlling feature visibility is not a security feature. To secure access to specific features on a per-user basis, you must configure [{{kib}} Security](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md).

4. Customize the avatar of the space to your liking.
5. Save your new space by selecting **Create space**.

You can edit all of the space settings you just defined at any time, except for the URL identifier.

Elastic also allows you to manage spaces using APIs:

* **Serverless projects:** [Spaces API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/serverless/operation/operation-get-spaces-space)
* **{{stack}} deployments:** [Spaces API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-post-spaces-copy-saved-objects)


## Define access to a space [spaces-control-user-access]

Users can access spaces based on the roles that they have.

* Certain reserved roles can view and access all spaces by default. You can’t prevent those roles from accessing a space. Instead, you can grant different roles to your users.
* When creating or editing a role, you can define which existing spaces that role can access, and with which permissions. Role management differs between {{stack}} deployments and serverless projects.
  - For Serverless projects, check [Custom roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md).
  - For {{stack}} deployments, check [Creating or editing a role](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md).


If you're managing an {{stack}} deployment, then you can also assign roles and define permissions for a space from the **Permissions** tab of the space settings.

When a role is assigned to *All Spaces*, you can’t remove its access from the space settings. You must instead edit the role to give it more granular access to individual spaces.


## Move saved objects between spaces [spaces-moving-objects]

To move saved objects between spaces, you can [copy objects](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/saved-objects.md#managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space), or [export and import objects](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/saved-objects.md#managing-saved-objects-export-objects).


## Customize {{kib}}'s home page [spaces-default-route]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga
serverless:
  observability: ga
  elasticsearch: unavailable
  security: unavailable
```

Customize the {{kib}} landing page on a per-space basis to create a tailored experience for users. For example, you can direct users to a specific dashboard, application, or saved object. Users navigate to the custom landing page when: 
- They enter the space.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3` They select the {icon}`logo_elastic` logo in the header.

To configure the landing page, use the default route setting in the [{{kib}} advanced settings](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#kibana-general-settings). For example, you might set the default route to `/app/dashboards`.

You can access the **Advanced Settings** management page in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

## Delete a space [_delete_a_space]

Deleting a space permanently removes the space and all of its contents. Find the space on the **Spaces** overview page and click the trash icon in the Actions column. You can’t delete the default space, but you can customize it to your liking.
