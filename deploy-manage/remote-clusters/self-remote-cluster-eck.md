# Connect self-managed clusters to {{eck}} [self-to-eck-remote-clusters]

These steps describe how to configure a remote cluster connection from a self-managed {{es}} cluster, to an {{eck}} (ECK) managed cluster.

After the connection is established, you’ll be able to [run {{ccs-init}} queries from {{es}}](/explore-analyze/cross-cluster-search.md) or [set up {{ccr-init}}](/deploy-manage/tools/cross-cluster-replication/set-up-cross-cluster-replication.md).

#### Make sure both clusters trust each other's certificate authority [mtls-setup-eck]

:::{include} _snippets/eck_rcs_mtls_intro.md
:::

In this example:

* The remote cluster resides inside Kubernetes and is managed by ECK
* The local cluster is a self-managed cluster running outside of Kubernetes.

To allow mutual TLS authentication between the clusters:

1. Extract and save the transport CAs of both clusters:

    1. For the ECK-managed cluster:

        :::{include} _snippets/eck_rcs_certs_retrieve_ca.md
        :::

    2. For the self-managed cluster, retrieve the transport CA from any of the nodes of the cluster. You can save it as `self-managed_ca.crt`.

2. Configure the self-managed cluster to trust the transport CA of the ECK-managed cluster as follows:

    Add the ECK-managed cluster’s CA to the list of CAs in [`xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate_authorities`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/security-settings.md#_pem_encoded_files_3).

3. Configure the ECK-managed cluster to trust the transport CA of the self-managed cluster:

    1. Create a ConfigMap with the CA certificate you extracted previously:

        ```sh
        kubectl create configmap remote-certs --from-file=ca.crt=<self-managed_ca.crt> <1>
        ```
        1. Substitute `<self-managed_ca.crt>` with the name of the file containing the transport CA of the self-managed cluster.       

    2. Configure the {{es}} resource manifest to trust the config map's CA through the `spec.transport.tls.certificate_authorities` setting:

        ```yaml subs=true
        apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
        kind: Elasticsearch
        metadata:
          name: <remote-cluster-name>
        spec:
          version: {{version.stack}}
          transport:
            tls:
              certificateAuthorities:
                configMapName: remote-certs
          nodeSets:
          - count: 3
            name: default
        ```

This guide uses the `proxy` connection mode, connecting to the remote cluster through the Kubernetes service abstraction. Refer to [connection modes](./connection-modes.md) documentation for details on each mode and their connectivity requirements.
