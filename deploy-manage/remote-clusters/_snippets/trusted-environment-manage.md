From a deployment's **Security** page, you can manage trusted environments that were created previously. This can happen when:

* You no longer need a trusted environment and want to remove it.
* You want to refresh the certificate, or add or remove trusted deployments of an existing trusted environment relying on certificates as a security model.
* You want to remove or update the access level granted by a cross-cluster API key.
