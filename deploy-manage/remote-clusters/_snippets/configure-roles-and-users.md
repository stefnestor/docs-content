% this will need improvement in a future PR, as the text below is only valid for API key based security model

If you're using the API key based security model, to use a remote cluster for {{ccr}} or {{ccs}}, you need to create user roles with [remote indices privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/role-structure.md#roles-remote-indices-priv) on the local cluster. Refer to [Configure roles and users](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md#remote-clusters-privileges-api-key).
