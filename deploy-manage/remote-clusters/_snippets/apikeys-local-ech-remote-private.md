It requires remote_type substitution to be defined
-->
1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. On the home page, find your hosted deployment and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the **Hosted deployments** page to view all of your deployments.

    On the **Hosted deployments** page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. From the navigation menu, select **Security**.
4. Select **Remote Connections > Add trusted environment** and choose **{{remote_type}}**. Then click **Next**.
5. Select **API keys** as authentication mechanism and click **Next**.
6. When asked whether the Certificate Authority (CA) of the remote environment’s proxy or load-balancing infrastructure is public, select **No, it is private**.
7. Add the API key:

    1. Fill both fields.

        * For the **Remote cluster name**, enter the alias of your choice. You will use this alias to connect to the remote cluster later. It must be lowercase and only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.
        * For the **Cross-cluster API key**, paste the encoded cross-cluster API key.

    2. Click **Add** to save the API key to the keystore.
    3. Repeat these steps for each API key you want to add. For example, if you want to use several clusters of the remote environment for CCR or CCS.

8. Add the CA certificate of the remote environment.
9. Provide a name for the trusted environment. That name will appear in the trust summary of your deployment's **Security** page.
10. Select **Create trust** to complete the configuration.
11. Restart the local deployment to reload the keystore with its new setting. To do that, go to the deployment's main page, locate the **Actions** menu, and select **Restart {{es}}**.

    ::::{note}
    If the local deployment runs on version 8.14 or greater, you no longer need to perform this step because the keystore is reloaded automatically with the new API keys.

If you need to update the remote connection with different permissions later, refer to [Change a cross-cluster API key used for a remote connection](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters/ec-edit-remove-trusted-environment.md#edit-remove-trusted-environment-api-key).
