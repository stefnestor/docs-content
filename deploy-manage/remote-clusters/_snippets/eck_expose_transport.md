Expose the transport service (defaults to port `9300`) of your ECK cluster to allow external {{es}} clusters to connect:

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
spec:
  transport:
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer <1>
```

1. On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting the type field to `LoadBalancer` provisions a load balancer for your service. Alternatively, expose the service `<cluster-name>-es-transport` through one of the Kubernetes Ingress controllers that support TCP services.
