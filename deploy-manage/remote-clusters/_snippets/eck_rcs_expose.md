When the remote cluster server is enabled, ECK automatically creates a Kubernetes service named `<cluster-name>-es-remote-cluster` that exposes the server internally on port `9443`.

To allow clusters running outside your Kubernetes environment to connect to this {{es}} cluster, you must expose this service externally. The way to expose this service depends on your ECK version.

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} eck: ga 3.3
You can customize how the remote cluster service is exposed by overriding its service specification directly under `spec.remoteClusterServer.service` in the {{es}} resource. By default, this service listens on port 9443.

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  version: 9.2.1
  remoteClusterServer:
    enabled: true
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer <1>
  nodeSets:
    - name: default
      count: 3
      ...
      ...
```
1. On cloud providers that support external load balancers, setting the type to `LoadBalancer` provisions a load balancer for your service. Alternatively, expose the service `<cluster-name>-es-remote-cluster` through one of the Kubernetes Ingress controllers that support TCP services.

In ECK 3.2 and earlier, you can't customize the service that ECK generates for the remote cluster interface, but you can create your own `LoadBalancer` service, `Ingress` object, or use another method available in your environment.

For example, for a cluster named `quickstart`, the following command creates a separate `LoadBalancer` service named `quickstart-es-remote-cluster-lb`, pointing to the ECK-managed service `quickstart-es-remote-cluster`:

```sh
kubectl expose service quickstart-es-remote-cluster \
  --name=quickstart-es-remote-cluster-lb \
  --type=LoadBalancer \ <1>
  --port=9443 --target-port=9443
```

:::{warning}
If you change the service’s `port`, set `targetPort` explicitly to `9443`, which is the default remote cluster server listening port. Otherwise, Kubernetes uses the same value for both fields, resulting in failed connections.
