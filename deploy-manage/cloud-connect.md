# Cloud Connect

Cloud Connect enables you to use {{ecloud}} services in your [ECE](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise.md), [ECK](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s.md), or [self-managed](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md) cluster without having to install and maintain their infrastructure yourself. In this way, you can get faster access to new features without adding to your operational overhead.

The following services are available for use with Cloud Connect. More services are coming soon.

## AutoOps

[AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) is a monitoring tool that helps you manage your cluster with real-time issue detection, performance recommendations, and resolution paths. By analyzing hundreds of {{es}} metrics, your configuration, and your usage patterns, AutoOps recommends operational and monitoring insights that deliver real savings in administration time and hardware cost. 

AutoOps can be connected to clusters on {{es}} version 7.17 and later.

## Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)

[Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md) enables you to add AI-powered search and assistance to your {{es}} deployment without running models yourself.
You can use EIS to enable features such as:

- [Semantic search](/solutions/search/semantic-search.md)
- [AI Assistants](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-assistant.md)
- [Agent Builder](/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder.md)
- [Attack Discovery](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery.md)

For a full list of EIS-powered features, refer to [AI features powered by EIS](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md#ai-features-powered-by-eis).

EIS can be connected to clusters on {{es}} version 9.3 and later.
