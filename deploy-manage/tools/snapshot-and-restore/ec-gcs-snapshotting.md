# Configure a GCS snapshot repository in {{ech}}

Configure a custom snapshot repository using your Google Cloud Storage account.


## Set up your service account credentials [ec-gcs-service-account-key]

You’ll need to have an existing Google Cloud account and have the appropriate permissions to generate credentials.

1. Create a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) in your Google Cloud project.

    The service account should be configured to have permission to read, write, and list the bucket objects. For more information, refer to [Recommended bucket permission](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/google-cloud-storage-repository.md#repository-gcs-bucket-permission) in the {{es}} docs.

2. Save the service account key in JSON file format. You are going to use it later to configure your {{es}} deployment for snapshotting.

For more detailed information on the JSON account service key, refer to [Using a Service Account](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/google-cloud-storage-repository.md#repository-gcs-using-service-account).


## Prepare a bucket [ec-prepare-gcs-bucket]

Follow the Google Cloud Storage documentation to [create a GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).


## Configure the keystore [ec-configure-gcs-keystore]

Create an entry for the GCS client in the {{es}} keystore:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Navigate to the **Security** page of the deployment you wish to configure.
3. Locate **{{es}} keystore** and select **Add settings**.
4. Enter the **Setting name** `gcs.client.secondary.credentials_file`.
5. With **Type** set to **JSON block / file**, add your [GCS service account key JSON file](#ec-gcs-service-account-key).
6. Select **Save**.

## Create the repository [ec-create-gcs-repository]

1. Open {{kib}} and go to **Management** > **Snapshot and Restore**.
2. On the **Repositories** tab, select **Register a repository**.
3. Provide a name for your repository and select type **Google Cloud Storage**.
4. Provide the following settings:

    * Client: `secondary`
    * Bucket: Your GCS bucket name
    * Base path: A directory to contain the snapshots

        * This setting is optional. Include a `base_path` if you have multiple clusters writing to the same GCS repository. This ensures that a snapshot won’t overwrite the snapshot metadata for another cluster.

5. Add any other settings that you wish to configure.
6. Select **Register**.
7. Select **Verify** to confirm that your settings are correct and the deployment can connect to your repository.

Your snapshot repository is now set up using GCS! You can use {{kib}} to manage your snapshots and begin sending {{es}} snapshots to your own bucket. For details, check the [Snapshot and Restore](create-snapshots.md) documentation.
