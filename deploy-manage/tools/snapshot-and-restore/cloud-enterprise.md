# Manage snapshot repositories in {{ece}} [ece-manage-repositories]

Snapshots enable you to back up and restore {{es}} indices, protecting data from accidental deletion and supporting migration between clusters. In {{ece}} (ECE), snapshot repositories are managed at the platform level and can be assigned to individual deployments.

When a repository is assigned to a deployment, a snapshot is taken every 30 minutes by default. The snapshot interval can be adjusted per deployment.

## Supported repository types

{{ece}} installations support the following {{es}} snapshot repository types:

* AWS S3
* Azure Blob Storage
* Google Cloud Storage
* MinIO S3

::::{note}
No repository types other than those listed are supported in the {{ece}} platform, even if they are supported by {{es}}.
::::


For more details about how snapshots are used with {{es}}, check [Snapshot and Restore](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore.md). You can also review the official documentation for these storage repository options:

* [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)
* [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/)

::::{tip}
If you are installing ECE without internet access (commonly called an offline or air-gapped installation), you will need to use an on-premise storage service.  We suggest that you use [MinIO](https://www.minio.io/). For our installation notes, check [Snapshotting to MinIO On-Premise Storage](minio-on-premise-repository.md).

## Add snapshot repository configurations [ece-manage-repositories-add]

The following guides provide instructions on adding a snapshot repository in ECE for all supported types:

* [AWS S3](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/ece-aws-custom-repository.md)
* [Azure](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/azure-storage-repository.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/google-cloud-storage-gcs-repository.md)
* [MinIO](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/minio-on-premise-repository.md)

## Edit snapshot repository configurations [ece_edit_snapshot_repository_configurations]

To edit a snapshot repository configuration from your {{ece}} installation:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. From the **Platform** menu, select **Repositories**.
3. Select **Edit** to modify a snapshot repository configuration.
4. Select **Save**.


## Delete snapshot repository configurations [ece_delete_snapshot_repository_configurations]

Deleting a snapshot repository configuration does not remove the snapshot repository itself from S3. Only the configuration that enables {{ece}} to access the repository is removed. Existing snapshots are also retained and need to be deleted separately if you no longer need them.

To delete a snapshot repository configuration from your {{ece}} installation:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. From the **Platform** menu, select **Repositories**.
3. Find the repository name that you want to remove.
4. Run the following command against the repository name:

    ```sh
    curl -s -XDELETE -u USER:PASSWORD https://$COORDINATOR_HOST:12443/api/v1/platform/configuration/snapshots/repositories/REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

    ::::{note}
    The user must have sufficient privileges, such as the `admin` user.

## Manage {{es}} cluster repositories [ece-manage-repositories-clusters]

You might need to update existing {{es}} clusters to use a different snapshot repository for one of the following reasons:

* If you do not want all snapshots for a specific {{es}} cluster to go into the same bucket as your other clusters, you can add a new snapshot repository configuration with separate permissions and then change your {{es}} cluster to use the new repository.
* If you created an {{es}} cluster with no snapshot repository configured, you can add a repository later on. {{ece}} will start taking snapshots of the cluster automatically.

To change the snapshot repository for an existing {{es}} cluster:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. Optional: If you need to use a repository that is not yet listed, add a snapshot repository configuration first.
3. From the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

4. From the **Elasticsearch** menu, select **Snapshots**.
5. Under **Snapshot repository**, choose a different repository and select **Save repository**.

Future snapshots will be sent to the new repository.
