# Upgrade your deployment on {{eck}} (ECK)

The ECK orchestrator can safely perform upgrades to newer versions of the {{stack}}.

Before you start the upgrade, [plan your upgrade](/deploy-manage/upgrade/plan-upgrade.md), [take the upgrade preparation steps](/deploy-manage/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade.md), and ensure your ECK version is [compatible](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s.md#stack-compatibility) with the {{stack}} version you’re upgrading to. If it's incompatible, [upgrade your orchestrator](/deploy-manage/upgrade/orchestrator/upgrade-cloud-on-k8s.md) first.

## Perform the upgrade

1. In the resource spec file, modify the `version` field for the desired {{stack}} version.
2. Save your changes. The orchestrator will start the upgrade process automatically.

In this example, we’re modifying the version to {{version.stack}}.

:::{important}
For production use, for {{stack}} version 8.16 and later, set the `vm.max_map_count` kernel setting to `1048576`; for {{stack}} version 8.15 and earlier, set `vm.max_map_count` to `262144`.

ECK will ensure that {{stack}} components are upgraded in the correct order. Upgrades to dependent resources are delayed until that dependency is upgraded. For example, the {{kib}} upgrade will start only when the associated {{es}} cluster has been upgraded.

Check out [Nodes orchestration](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/nodes-orchestration.md) for more information on how ECK manages upgrades and how to tune its behavior.

## Next steps

Once you've successfully upgraded your deployment, you can [upgrade your ingest components](/deploy-manage/upgrade/ingest-components.md), such as {{ls}}, {{agents}}, or {{beats}}.
