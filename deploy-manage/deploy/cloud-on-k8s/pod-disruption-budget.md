# Pod disruption budget [k8s-pod-disruption-budget]

A [Pod Disruption Budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) (PDB) allows you to limit the disruption to your application when its pods need to be rescheduled for some reason such as upgrades or routine maintenance work on the Kubernetes nodes.

{{eck}} manages either a single default PDB, or multiple PDBs per {{es}} resource depending on the license level of the ECK installation.

:::{note}
In {{eck}} 3.1 and earlier, all clusters follow the [default PodDisruptionBudget rules](#default-pdb-rules), regardless of license type.
:::

## Advanced rules (Enterprise license required)
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  eck: ga 3.2
```

In Elasticsearch clusters managed by ECK and licensed with an Enterprise license, a separate PDB is created for each type of `nodeSet` defined in the manifest. This setup allows Kubernetes upgrade or maintenance operations to be executed more quickly. Each PDB permits one Elasticsearch Pod per `nodeSet` to be disrupted at a time, provided the Elasticsearch cluster maintains the health status described in the following table:

| Role | Cluster health required | Notes |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| master | Yellow |  |
| data | Green | All Data roles are grouped together into a single PDB, except for data_frozen. |
| data_frozen | Yellow | Since frozen data tier nodes only host partially mounted indices backed by searchable snapshots additional disruptions are allowed. |
| ingest | Yellow |  |
| ml | Yellow |  |
| coordinating | Yellow |  |
| transform | Yellow |  |
| remote_cluster_client | Yellow |  |

Single-node clusters are not considered highly available and can always be disrupted regardless of license type.

## Default rules (Basic license) [default-pdb-rules]
:::{note}
In {{eck}} 3.1 and earlier, all clusters follow this behavior regardless of license type.
:::

In {{eck}} clusters that do not have an Enterprise license, one {{es}} Pod can be taken down at a time, as long as the cluster has a health status of `green`. Single-node clusters are not considered highly available and can always be disrupted.

## Overriding the default behavior

In the {{es}} specification, you can change the default behavior in two ways. By fully overriding the PodDisruptionBudget within the {{es}} spec or by disabling the default PodDisruptionBudget and specifying one or more PodDisruptionBudget(s).

### Specify your own PodDisruptionBudget [k8s-specify-own-pdb]

You can fully override the default PodDisruptionBudget by specifying your own PodDisruptionBudget in the {{es}} spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  version: {{version.stack}}
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 3
  podDisruptionBudget:
    spec:
      minAvailable: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/cluster-name: quickstart
```

This will cause the ECK operator to only create the PodDisruptionBudget defined in the spec. It will not create any additional PodDisruptionBudgets.

::::{note}
[`maxUnavailable`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/#arbitrary-controllers-and-selectors) cannot be used with an arbitrary label selector, therefore `minAvailable` is used in this example.
::::

### Create a PodDisruptionBudget per nodeSet [k8s-pdb-per-nodeset]

You can specify a PDB per `nodeSet` or node role.

```yaml subs=true
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  podDisruptionBudget: {} <1>
  version: {{version.stack}}
  nodeSets:
    - name: master
      count: 3
      config:
        node.roles: "master"
        node.store.allow_mmap: false
    - name: hot
      count: 2
      config:
        node.roles: ["data_hot", "data_content", "ingest"]
        node.store.allow_mmap: false

apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: hot-nodes-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 1 <5>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/cluster-name: quickstart <3>
      elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/statefulset-name: quickstart-es-hot <6>
```

1. Disable the default {{es}} pod disruption budget.
2. Specify pod disruption budget to have 2 master nodes available.
3. The pods should be in the "quickstart" cluster.
4. Pod disruption budget applies on all master nodes.
5. Specify pod disruption budget to have 1 hot node available.
6. Pod disruption budget applies on nodes of the same nodeset.
