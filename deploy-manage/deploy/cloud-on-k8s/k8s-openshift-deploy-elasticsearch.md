# Deploy an {{es}} instance with a route [k8s-openshift-deploy-elasticsearch]

Use the following code to create an {{es}} cluster `elasticsearch-sample` and a "passthrough" route to access it:

::::{note}
A namespace other than the default namespaces (default, kube-system, kube-**, openshift-**, etc) is required such that default [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html) (SCC) permissions are applied automatically. Elastic resources will not work properly in any of the default namespaces.

```shell subs=true
cat <<EOF | oc apply -n elastic -f -
# This sample sets up an Elasticsearch cluster with an OpenShift route
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-sample
spec:
  version: {{version.stack}}
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 1
    config:
      node.store.allow_mmap: false

  #host: elasticsearch.example.com # override if you don't want to use the host that is automatically generated by OpenShift (<route-name>[-<namespace>].<suffix>)
  tls:
    termination: passthrough # Elasticsearch is the TLS endpoint

```

## {{es}} plugins [k8s-openshift-es-plugins]

{{es}} plugins cannot be installed at runtime in most OpenShift environments. This is because the plugin installer must run as root, but {{es}} is restricted from running as root. To add plugins to {{es}}, you can use custom images as described in [*Create custom images*](create-custom-images.md).
