# Deploy an Elasticsearch instance with a route [k8s-openshift-deploy-elasticsearch]

Use the following code to create an Elasticsearch cluster `elasticsearch-sample` and a "passthrough" route to access it:

::::{note} 
A namespace other than the default namespaces (default, kube-system, kube-**, openshift-**, etc) is required such that default [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.md) (SCC) permissions are applied automatically. Elastic resources will not work properly in any of the default namespaces.
::::


```shell
cat <<EOF | oc apply -n elastic -f -
# This sample sets up an Elasticsearch cluster with an OpenShift route
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-sample
spec:
  version: 8.16.1
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 1
    config:
      node.store.allow_mmap: false

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-sample
spec:
  #host: elasticsearch.example.com # override if you don't want to use the host that is automatically generated by OpenShift (<route-name>[-<namespace>].<suffix>)
  tls:
    termination: passthrough # Elasticsearch is the TLS endpoint
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: elasticsearch-sample-es-http
EOF
```

## Elasticsearch plugins [k8s-openshift-es-plugins]

Elasticsearch plugins cannot be installed at runtime in most OpenShift environments. This is because the plugin installer must run as root, but Elasticsearch is restricted from running as root. To add plugins to Elasticsearch, you can use custom images as described in [*Create custom images*](create-custom-images.md).
