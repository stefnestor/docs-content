There are two options to create serverless projects:

* If you are a new user, [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration) to create a serverless project. For more information about the {{ecloud}} trials, check [Trial features](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/create-an-organization.md#general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial).
* If you are an existing customer, [log in to {{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/login). On the home page, you will see a new option to create serverless projects. The `admin` predefined role or an equivalent custom role is required to create projects. Refer to [](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md).
