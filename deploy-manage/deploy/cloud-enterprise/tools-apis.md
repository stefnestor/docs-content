You can use these tools and APIs to interact with the following {{ece}} features:

* [{{ecloud}} Control (ecctl)](ecctl://reference/index.md): Wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.
* [ECE scripts](cloud://reference/cloud-enterprise/scripts.md): Use the `elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh` script to install {{ece}} or modify your installation.
* [ECE diagnostics tool](/troubleshoot/deployments/cloud-enterprise/run-ece-diagnostics-tool.md): Collect logs and metrics that you can send to Elastic Support for troubleshooting and investigation purposes.
