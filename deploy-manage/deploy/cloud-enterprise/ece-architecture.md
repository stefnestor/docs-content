# Service-oriented architecture [ece-architecture]

{{ece}} has a service-oriented architecture that lets you:

* Scale each service separately, with different reliability and performance requirements.
* Access services through the API.
* Deploy each service independently in its own Docker container.

## Control plane [ece_control_plane]

The *control plane* of ECE include the following management services:

**ZooKeeper**

* [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a distributed, strongly consistent data store.
* Holds essential information for ECE components: Proxy routing tables, memory capacity advertised by the allocators, changes committed through Admin Console, and so on.
* Acts as a message bus for communication between the services.
* Talks to ECE components using STunnel.
* Stores the state of the ECE installation and the state of all deployments running in ECE.

**Director**

* Manages the ZK data store and signs the CSRs (certificate signing requests) for internal clients that want to communicate with ZooKeeper.
* Maintains the stunnels used by ZooKeeper for communication and establishes quorum when new ZooKeeper nodes are created.

**Constructor**

* Works like a scheduler that monitors requests from the Admin console.
* Determines what needs to be changed, and writes the changes to ZooKeeper nodes monitored by the allocators.
* Assigns cluster nodes to allocators.
* Maximizes the utilization of underlying allocators to reduce the need to spin up extra hardware for new deployments.
* Places cluster nodes and instances within different availability zones to ensure that the deployment can survive any downtime of a whole zone. You can designate these availability zones when you install ECE.

**Cloud UI and API**

Provide web and API access for administrators to manage and monitor the ECE installation.


## Proxies [ece_proxies]

* Handle user requests, mapping deployment IDs that are passed in request URLs for the container to the actual {{es}} cluster nodes and other instances. The association of deployment IDs to a container is stored in ZooKeeper, cached by the proxies. In the event of ZooKeeper downtime, the platform can still service the requests to existing deployments by using the cache.
* Keep track of the state and availability of zones, if you have a highly available {{es}} cluster. If one of the zones goes down, the proxy will not route any requests there.
* Help with no-downtime scaling and upgrades. Before performing an upgrade, a snapshot is taken, and data is migrated to the new nodes. When the migration is complete, a proxy switches the traffic to the new nodes and disconnects the old ones.
* Multiple proxies are usually configured behind a load balancer to ensure that the system remains available.


## Allocators [ece-architecture-allocators]

* Run on all the machines that host {{es}} nodes and {{kib}} instances.
* Control the lifecycle of cluster nodes by:

    * Creating new containers and starting {{es}} nodes when requested
    * Restarting a node if it becomes unresponsive
    * Removing a node if it is no longer needed

* Advertise the memory capacity of the underlying host machine to ZooKeeper so that the Constructor can make an informed decision on where to deploy.

## Services as Docker containers [ece-containerization]

Services are deployed as Docker containers, which simplifies the operational effort and makes it easy to provision similar environments for development and staging. Using Docker containers has the following advantages:

* **Shares of resources**

    Each cluster node is run within a Docker container to make sure that all of the nodes have access to a guaranteed share of host resources. This mitigates the *noisy neighbor effect* where one busy deployment can overwhelm the entire host. The CPU resources are relative to the size of the {{es}} cluster they get assigned to. For example, a cluster with 32GB of RAM gets assigned twice as many CPU resources as a cluster with 16GB of RAM.

* **Better security**

    On the assumption that any cluster can be compromised, containers are given no access to the platform. The same is true for the services: each service can read or write only those parts of the system state that are relevant to it. Even if some services are compromised, the attacker won’t get hold of the keys to the rest of them and will not compromise the whole platform.

* **Secure communication through Stunnel**

    Docker containers communicate securely with one another through Transport Layer Security, provided by [Stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) (as not all of the services or components support TLS natively). Tunneling all traffic between containers makes sure that it is not possible to eavesdrop, even when someone else has access to the underlying cloud or network infrastructure.

## ECE service containers by host role [ece-service-containers]

Each {{ece}} service runs as a dedicated container. These containers are automatically deployed based on the roles assigned to each ECE host. The following table lists the containers on ECE hosts, along with the host roles that include each container:

| Container                                         | Host roles    | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `frc-runners-runner`                              | All roles     | Runs on every ECE host and provides a supervisor service to deploy and manage containers based on the host's assigned roles, ensuring required containers are started at the proper version. |
| `frc-beats-runners-beats-runner`                  | All roles     | Collects logs and metrics from local containers for monitoring and health checks. |
| `frc-client-forwarders-client-forwarder`          | All roles     | Manages communication between services on the hosts and ZooKeeper. |
| `frc-services-forwarders-services-forwarder`      | All roles     | Routes internal service data across the ECE platform. |
| `frc-allocators-allocator`                        | Allocator     | Manages container lifecycle for {{stack}} application instances, such as {{es}} and {{kib}}. |
| `frc-allocator-metricbeats-allocator-metricbeat`  | Allocator     | Collects metrics from the {{stack}} containers running in the allocator. |
| `frc-container-task-services-container-task-service` | Allocator  | Supports autoscaling and tracks feature usage. |
| `frc-admin-consoles-admin-console`                | Controller    | Backend service for the ECE UI that handles API requests. |
| `frc-blueprints-blueprint`                        | Controller    | Coordinates container startup by providing configuration data to runners based on their role and token. |
| `frc-cloud-uis-cloud-ui`                          | Controller    | Web frontend for the ECE UI, served to users in the browser. |
| `frc-constructors-constructor`                    | Controller    | Schedules and coordinates deployment changes; assigns instances to allocators and balances zones. |
| `frc-directors-director`                          | Director      | Coordinates the ZooKeeper cluster by ensuring there's a quorum; maintains stunnel configuration and certificates. |
| `frc-zookeeper-servers-zookeeper`                 | Director      | Consistent distributed data store used to track ECE state and coordinate communication between services. |
| `frc-proxies-proxyv2`                             | Proxy         | Routes user traffic to the {{stack}} deployments. |
| `frc-proxies-route-server`                        | Proxy         | Manages the routing tables used by the proxy service. |
