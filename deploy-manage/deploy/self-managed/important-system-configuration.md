# Important system configuration [system-config]

Ideally, {{es}} should run alone on a server and use all of the resources available to it. In order to do so, you need to configure your operating system to allow the user running {{es}} to access more resources than allowed by default.

The following settings **must** be considered before going to production:

* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/elasticsearch-service-user.md): Run as a dedicated unprivileged user, keep numeric UID and GID consistent across nodes, and set correct ownership on config and data paths.
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/setting-system-settings.md): Where and how to apply operating-system limits and environment variables for your install type.
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/setup-configuration-memory.md): Avoid heap or process memory being swapped out; options include disabling swap, lowering swappiness, and `bootstrap.memory_lock`.
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/vm-max-map-count.md): Set `vm.max_map_count` high enough for mmap-based index storage (for example `1048576` when required).
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/max-number-of-threads.md): Allow the {{es}} user to create at least `4096` threads on Linux when you manage limits yourself.
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/file-descriptors.md): Raise open file handles to at least `65,535` (Linux and macOS only).
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/executable-jna-tmpdir.md): Ensure JNA and native libraries can execute from a temp path that is not mounted `noexec` (Linux only).
* [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/system-config-tcpretries.md): Lower `net.ipv4.tcp_retries2` so node and network failures are detected sooner than the Linux default (Linux only).

::::{admonition} How these limits are enforced
This page lists operating system limits you must set before {{es}} serves production traffic. {{es}} verifies many of these expectations through [bootstrap checks](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/bootstrap-checks.md) at node startup. In production mode, a failed check stops the node from starting rather than only logging a warning.
