# Add plugins [modules-plugins]

Plugins are a way to enhance the basic {{es}} functionality in a custom manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers (in a more built in fashion), custom script engines, custom discovery and more.

For information about selecting and installing plugins, see [{{es}} plugins](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch-plugins/index.md).

For information about developing your own plugin, see [Create {{es}} plugins](elasticsearch://extend/index.md).
