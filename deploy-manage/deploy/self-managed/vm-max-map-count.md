# Increase virtual memory [vm-max-map-count]

{{es}} uses a [`mmapfs`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/store.md#mmapfs) directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts could be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions.

:::{admonition} Verify vm.max_map_count configuration
If the operating system's default `vm.max_map_count` value is `1048576` or higher, no configuration change is necessary. If the default value is lower than `1048576`, configure the `vm.max_map_count` parameter to `1048576`.
:::

On Linux, you can increase the limits by running the following command as `root`:

```sh
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576
```

To set this value permanently, update the `vm.max_map_count` setting in `/etc/sysctl.conf`. To verify after rebooting, run `sysctl vm.max_map_count`.

The RPM and Debian packages will configure this setting automatically. No further configuration is required.

You can find out the current mmap count of a running {{es}} process using the following command, where `$PID` is the process ID of the running {{es}} process:

```sh
wc -l /proc/$PID/maps
```
