## Elastic Cloud email service

{{ecloud}} provides a built-in email service used by the preconfigured [email connector](kibana://reference/connectors-kibana/email-action-type.md), available in both {{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects. This service can be used to send [alert](/explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts.md) notifications and is also supported in {{ech}} by [Watcher](/explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher/enable-watcher.md).

### Email service limits

The following quotas apply to both {{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects when using the Elastic email service:

* Email sending quota: 500 emails per 15 minute period.
* Maximum number of recipients per message: 30 recipients per email (To, CC, and BCC all count as recipients).
* Maximum message size (including attachments): 10 MB per message (after Base64 encoding).
* The email-sender can't be customized (Any custom `From:` header will be removed).
