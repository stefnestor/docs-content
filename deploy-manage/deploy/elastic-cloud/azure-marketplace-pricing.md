# Azure Marketplace pricing [ec-azure-marketplace-pricing]

The pricing in Azure Marketplace defines how on-demand usage and prepaid fees get converted from ECUs and discounts into the local currency in which you transact on Azure Marketplace.

We will be updating the pricing plan for {{ecloud}} on Azure Marketplace effective January 1st, 2024. This update will affect customers paying in non-USD currencies.


## Why we’re making these changes [ec_why_were_making_these_changes]

The pricing plan update enables us to align with market trends and adapt to changing economic conditions, ensuring that we continue delivering the highest standard of service.


## Who is affected [ec_who_is_affected]

These pricing changes will apply to customers who are currently paying for Azure Marketplace services in non-USD currencies. If you are paying in USD, your pricing and billing will remain unchanged.
