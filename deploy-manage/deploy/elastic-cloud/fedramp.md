## Limitations [ec-fedramp-limitations]

There are some limitations to note for using the FedRAMP authorized Cloud offerings.

### TLS

**Applies to:** {{fedramp-mod}}, {{fedramp-high}}

% Copied from https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/security/fips-ingest#ingest-limitations-tls
% I'll single-source this if the finalized content is identical to what we have in the security section.

Only FIPS 140-2 compliant TLS protocols, ciphers, and curve types are allowed to be used as listed below.
* The supported TLS versions are `TLS v1.2` and `TLS v1.3`.
* The supported cipher suites are:
  * `TLS v1.2`: `ECDHE-RSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384`
  * `TLS v1.3`: `TLS-AES-128-GCM-SHA256`, `TLS-AES-256-GCM-SHA384`
* The supported curve types are `P-256`, `P-384` and `P-521`.

Support for encrypted private keys is not available, as the cryptographic modules used for decrypting password protected keys are not FIPS validated. If an output or any other component with an SSL key that is password protected is configured, the components will fail to load the key. When running in FIPS mode, you must provide non-encrypted keys.
Be sure to enforce security in your FIPS environments through other means, such as strict file permissions and access controls on the key file itself, for example.

### {{elastic-defend}}

**Applies to:** {{fedramp-mod}}, {{fedramp-high}}

The {{elastic-defend}} integration that runs on hosts being protected has various features that require data to be sent directly to Elastic-managed cloud services. The data sent is not sourced from within the secure enclave on the host. However, you may still want to adjust the configuration for your {{fedramp-mod}} and {{fedramp-high}} environments. You can use the [advanced setting](/reference/security/defend-advanced-settings.md) `[linux,mac,windows].advanced.allow_cloud_features` to activate or deactivate each {{elastic-defend}} feature individually.

### Custom plugins

**Applies to:** {{fedramp-high}}

Custom plugins are currently not supported in {{fedramp-high}} deployments.
