# Subscribe from a marketplace [ec-marketplaces]

You can subscribe to {{ecloud}} from a marketplace. Your subscription gets billed together with other services that you’re already using, and can contribute towards your spend commitment with cloud providers.

Trial availability and duration can vary depending on the marketplace.

When subscribing from a marketplace, your marketplace email is used for your [Elastic account](../../../cloud-account/update-your-email-address.md).

* [AWS Marketplace](aws-marketplace.md)
* [Azure Marketplace](azure-native-isv-service.md)
* [GCP Marketplace](google-cloud-platform-marketplace.md)
* [Heroku](heroku.md)

::::{note}
[Serverless projects](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless) are only available for the AWS Marketplace, and are in technical preview on the Azure Marketplace. Support for GCP Marketplace will be added in the near future.
