# Manage deployments [ec-manage-deployment]

Sometimes you might need to make changes to the entire deployment, a specific component, or just a single data tier.

* Make adjustments to specific deployment components, such as an [Integrations Server](manage-integrations-server.md), [APM & Fleet Server](switch-from-apm-to-integrations-server-payload.md#ec-manage-apm-and-fleet), [Watcher](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher.md), or [Kibana](access-kibana.md#ec-enable-kibana2).
* [Enable logging and monitoring](../../monitor/stack-monitoring/elastic-cloud-stack-monitoring.md) of the deployment performance.
* [Disable a data tier](../../../manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management.md).
* [Restart](../../maintenance/start-stop-services/restart-cloud-hosted-deployment.md), [stop routing](../../maintenance/ece/start-stop-routing-requests.md), or [delete your deployment](../../uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md).
* [Upgrade the Elastic Stack version](../../upgrade/deployment-or-cluster.md) for the deployment.
