# {{eck}} [k8s-overview]

Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, {{eck}} (ECK) extends the basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities to support the setup and management of {{eck_resources_list}} on Kubernetes.

:::{admonition} Use cloud services in your ECK environment with Cloud Connect
With [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md), you can use Elastic-managed cloud services in your ECK environment without having to install and manage their infrastructure yourself. In this way, you can get faster access to new features without adding to your operational overhead.
::::

## ECK overview

With {{eck}}, you can streamline critical operations, such as:

1. Managing and monitoring multiple clusters
2. Scaling cluster capacity and storage
3. Performing safe configuration changes through rolling upgrades
4. Securing clusters with TLS certificates
5. Setting up hot-warm-cold architectures with availability zone awareness

This section provides everything you need to install, configure, and manage {{stack}} applications with ECK, including:

- [](./cloud-on-k8s/deploy-an-orchestrator.md): ECK installation methods and configuration options. Deploy ECK on managed Kubernetes platforms like GKE, AKS, and EKS, on self-managed Kubernetes clusters, on OpenShift, and even in air-gapped environments.
- [](./cloud-on-k8s/manage-deployments.md): Handle {{es}} clusters and {{kib}} instances through ECK.
- [](./cloud-on-k8s/orchestrate-other-elastic-applications.md): Run {{eck_resources_list_short}} on Kubernetes.
- [](./cloud-on-k8s/tools-apis.md): A collection of tools and APIs available in ECK based environments.

Other sections of the documentation include the following important topics around ECK:

- [Logging and Monitoring](../monitor.md): Configure monitoring and logs forwarding with the help of ECK.
- [Remote Clusters](../remote-clusters.md): Configure remote clusters on ECK.
- [](../tools.md): Add snapshot repositories to your {{es}} clusters for automatic snapshots.
- [Security](../security.md): Secure communications, manage HTTP certificates, or add secure settings to your applications.
- [Users and Roles](../users-roles.md): Configure authentication and authorization mechanisms, built-in users, external providers, and more.
- [Autoscaling](../autoscaling.md): Learn how to use {{es}} autoscaling on ECK, or use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler functionality for stateless workloads.
- [Licensing](../license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md): Manage licenses on ECK.

::::{important}
ECK is an Elastic self-managed product offered in two licensing tiers: Basic and Enterprise. For more details refer to [Elastic subscriptions](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) and [](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md) documentation.

## Quickstart [eck-quickstart]

If you want to get started quickly, follow these guides to deploy ECK and set up an {{es}} cluster:

* [Install ECK using YAML manifests](./cloud-on-k8s/install-using-yaml-manifest-quickstart.md)
* [Deploy an {{es}} cluster](./cloud-on-k8s/elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md)
* [Deploy a {{kib}} instance](./cloud-on-k8s/kibana-instance-quickstart.md)

Afterwards, you can:

* Learn how to [update your deployment](./cloud-on-k8s/update-deployments.md)
* Check out [our recipes](./cloud-on-k8s/recipes.md) for multiple use cases
* Find further sample resources [in the project repository](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/{{version.eck | M.M}}/config/samples)

## Supported versions [k8s-supported]

This section outlines the supported Kubernetes and {{stack}} versions for ECK. Check the full [Elastic support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_kubernetes) for more information.

### Kubernetes compatibility

ECK is compatible with the following Kubernetes distributions and related technologies:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} ECK 3.2
* Kubernetes 1.30-1.34
* OpenShift 4.15-4.20
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Helm: {{eck_helm_minimum_version}}+
:::

:::{tab-item} ECK 3.1
* Kubernetes 1.29-1.33
* OpenShift 4.15-4.19
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Helm: {{eck_helm_minimum_version}}+
:::

:::{tab-item} ECK 3.0
* Kubernetes 1.28-1.32
* OpenShift 4.14-4.18
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Helm: {{eck_helm_minimum_version}}+
:::

::::

ECK should work with all conformant **installers** listed in these [FAQs](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/faq.md#what-is-a-distribution-hosted-platform-and-an-installer). Distributions include source patches and so may not work as-is with ECK.

Alpha, beta, and stable API versions follow the same [conventions used by Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning).

### {{stack}} compatibility [stack-compatibility]

ECK is compatible with the following {{stack}} applications:

* {{es}}, {{kib}}, APM Server: 7.17+, 8+, 9+
* Enterprise Search: 7.17+, 8+
* Beats: 7.17+, 8+, 9+
* Elastic Agent: 7.10+ (standalone), 7.17+ (Fleet), 8+, 9+
* Elastic Maps Server: 7.17+, 8+, 9+
* Logstash: 8.7+, 9+

{{stack}} application images for the OpenShift-certified {{es}} (ECK) Operator are only available from version 7.10 and later.
