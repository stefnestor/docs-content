# Configure SSL/TLS for self-managed Fleet Servers [secure-connections]

If you’re running a self-managed cluster, configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt traffic between {{agent}}s, {{fleet-server}}, and other components in the {{stack}}.

For the install settings specific to mutual TLS, as opposed to one-way TLS, refer to [{{agent}} deployment models with mutual TLS](/reference/fleet/mutual-tls.md).

For a summary of flow by which TLS is established between components using either one-way or mutual TLS, refer to [One-way and mutual TLS certifications flow](/reference/fleet/tls-overview.md).

::::{tip}
[{{ecloud}}](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service?page=docs&placement=docs-body) provides secure, encrypted connections out of the box!
::::


## Prerequisites [prereqs]

Configure security and generate certificates for the {{stack}}. For more information about securing the {{stack}}, refer to [Secure your cluster, deployment, or project](/deploy-manage/security/secure-your-cluster-deployment.md).

::::{important}
{{agent}}s require a PEM-formatted CA certificate to send encrypted data to {{es}}. If you followed the steps in [Secure your cluster, deployment, or project](/deploy-manage/security/secure-your-cluster-deployment.md), your certificate will be in a p12 file. To convert it, use OpenSSL:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out cert.crt -clcerts -nokeys
openssl pkcs12 -in path.p12 -out private.key -nocerts -nodes
```

Key passwords are not currently supported.

::::


::::{important}
When you run {{agent}} with the {{elastic-defend}} integration, note the following TLS certificate requirements:

* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1+` The [TLS certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) used to connect to {{fleet-server}} and {{es}} can use either [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) or Elliptic Curve (EC) keys.

* {applies_to}`stack: ga =9.0` The TLS certificates used to connect to {{fleet-server}} and {{es}} need to be generated using RSA.

For a full list of available algorithms to use when configuring TLS or mTLS, refer to [Configure SSL/TLS for standalone {{agents}}](/reference/fleet/elastic-agent-ssl-configuration.md). These settings are available for both standalone and {{fleet}}-managed {{agent}}.
::::


## Generate a custom certificate and private key for {{fleet-server}} [generate-fleet-server-certs]

This section describes how to use the `certutil` tool provided by {{es}}, but you can use whatever process you typically use to generate PEM-formatted certificates.

1. Generate a certificate authority (CA). Skip this step if you want to use an existing CA.

    ```shell
    ./bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca --pem
    ```

    This command creates a zip file that contains the CA certificate and key you’ll use to sign the {{fleet-server}} certificate. Extract the zip file:

    :::{image} images/ca.png
    :alt: Screen capture of a folder called ca that contains two files: ca.crt and ca.key
    :::

    Store the files in a secure location.

2. Use the certificate authority to generate certificates for {{fleet-server}}. For example:

    ```shell
    ./bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert \
      --name fleet-server \
      --ca-cert /path/to/ca/ca.crt \
      --ca-key /path/to/ca/ca.key \
      --dns your.host.name.here \
      --ip 192.0.2.1 \
      --pem
    ```

    Where `dns` and `ip` specify the name and IP address of the {{fleet-server}}. Run this command for each {{fleet-server}} you plan to deploy.

    This command creates a zip file that includes a `.crt` and `.key` file. Extract the zip file:

    :::{image} images/fleet-server-certs.png
    :alt: Screen capture of a folder called fleet-server that contains two files: fleet-server.crt and fleet-server.key
    :::

    Store the files in a secure location. You’ll need these files later to encrypt traffic between {{agent}}s and {{fleet-server}}.


## Configure SSL/TLS using CLI [fleet-server-ssl-cli-settings]

Use the CLI to configure SSL or TLS when installing or enrolling {{fleet-server}}. This method gives you granular control over certificate paths, verification modes, and authentication behavior.

::::{note}
The `install` command covers certificates, certificate authorities, keys, and client authentication, but not the allowed TLS versions (`supported_protocols`) or cipher suites (`cipher_suites`). To configure those, refer to [Configure advanced SSL/TLS settings for {{fleet-server}}](#fleet-server-advanced-ssl-settings).
::::

### Encrypt traffic between {{agent}}s, {{fleet-server}}, and {{es}} [_encrypt_traffic_between_agents_fleet_server_and_es]

{{fleet-server}} needs a CA certificate or the CA fingerprint to connect securely to {{es}}. It also needs to expose a {{fleet-server}} certificate so other {{agent}}s can connect to it securely.

For the steps in this section, imagine you have the following files:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| `ca.crt` | The CA certificate to use to connect to {{fleet-server}}. This is the CA used to [generate a certificate and key](#generate-fleet-server-certs) for {{fleet-server}}. |
| `fleet-server.crt` | The certificate you generated for {{fleet-server}}. |
| `fleet-server.key` | The private key you generated for {{fleet-server}}.<br>If the `fleet-server.key` file is encrypted with a passphrase, the passphrase will need to be specified through a file. |
| `elasticsearch-ca.crt` | The CA certificate to use to connect to {{es}}. This is the CA used to generate certs for {{es}} (see [Prerequisites](#prereqs)).<br>The CA certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint (hash) may be used instead of the `elasticsearch-ca.crt` file for securing connections to {{es}}. |

To encrypt traffic between {{agent}}s, {{fleet-server}}, and {{es}}:

1. Configure {{fleet}} settings. These settings are applied to all {{fleet}}-managed {{agent}}s.
2. In {{kib}}, open the main menu, then select **Management > {{fleet}} > Settings**.

    1. Under **{{fleet-server}} hosts**, specify the URLs {{agent}}s will use to connect to {{fleet-server}}. For example, [https://192.0.2.1:8220](https://192.0.2.1:8220), where 192.0.2.1 is the host IP where you will install {{fleet-server}}.

        ::::{tip}
        For host settings, use the `https` protocol. DNS-based names are also allowed.
        ::::

    2. In the **Outputs** section, search for the default output, then select the **Edit** icon in the **Actions** column.
    3. In the **Hosts** field, specify the {{es}} URLs where {{agent}}s will send data. For example, [https://192.0.2.0:9200](https://192.0.2.0:9200).
    4. Specify either a CA certificate or a CA fingerprint to connect securely to {{es}}:

        * If you have a valid HEX-encoded SHA-256 CA trusted fingerprint, specify it in the **Elasticsearch CA trusted fingerprint** field. The fingerprint must be for a CA certificate that's present in the certificate chain {{es}} sends during the TLS handshake. For more information, refer to [Using certificate fingerprints](/reference/fleet/certificate-fingerprints.md).
        * Otherwise, specify the certificate authorities to use to connect to {{es}}.
        
          You can specify the path to one or more CA certificates (if the files are available), or embed the certificate content directly. If you specify file paths, the certificates must be available on the hosts running the {{agent}}s.

          ::::{applies-switch}

          :::{applies-item} stack: ga 9.1+

          1. Expand the **Authentication** section.
          2. In the **Server SSL certificate authorities** field, specify the path to the CA certificate, or paste the certificate content directly.
          3. (Optional) Select **Add row** to provide additional certificate authorities.

          :::

          ::::{applies-item} stack: ga =9.0

          In the **Advanced YAML configuration** field, set `ssl.certificate_authorities` and specify one or more CA certificates to use to connect to {{es}}.

          File path example:

          ```yaml
          ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/path/to/your/elasticsearch-ca.crt"] <1>
          ```

          1. The path to the CA certificate on the {{agent}} host.

          Pasted certificate example:

          ```yaml
          ssl:
            certificate_authorities:
            - |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              MIIDSjCCAjKgAwIBAgIVAKlphSqJclcni3P83gVsirxzuDuwMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEB
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          ```
          :::
          ::::
        

    1. Install an {{agent}} as a {{fleet-server}} on the host and configure it to use TLS:

        1. If you don’t already have a {{fleet-server}} service token, select the **Agents** tab in {{fleet}} and follow the instructions to generate the service token now.

            ::::{tip}
            The in-product installation steps are incomplete. Before running the `install` command, add the settings shown in the next step.
            ::::

        2. From the directory where you extracted {{fleet-server}}, run the `install` command and specify the certificates to use.

            The following command installs {{agent}} as a service, enrolls it in the {{fleet-server}} policy, and starts the service.

            ::::{note}
            If you’re using DEB or RPM, or already have the {{agent}} installed, use the `enroll` command along with the following options, then start the service as described in [Start {{agent}}](/reference/fleet/start-stop-elastic-agent.md#start-elastic-agent-service).
            ::::


            ```shell
            sudo ./elastic-agent install \
               --url=https://192.0.2.1:8220 \

               --fleet-server-cert=/path/to/fleet-server.crt \
               --fleet-server-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-server.key \

               --fleet-server-client-auth=required
            ```

            Where:

            `url`
            :   {{fleet-server}} URL.

            `fleet-server-es`
            :   {{es}} URL

            `fleet-server-service-token`
            :   Service token to use to communicate with {{es}}.

            `fleet-server-policy`
            :   The specific policy that {{fleet-server}} will use.

            `fleet-server-es-ca`
            :   CA certificate that the current {{fleet-server}} uses to connect to {{es}}.

            `certificate-authorities`
            :   List of paths to PEM-encoded CA certificate files that should be trusted for the other {{agents}} to connect to this {{fleet-server}}

            `fleet-server-cert`
            :   The path for the PEM-encoded certificate (or certificate chain) which is associated with the fleet-server-cert-key to expose this {{fleet-server}} HTTPS endpoint to the other {{agents}}

            `fleet-server-cert-key`
            :   Private key to use to expose this {{fleet-server}} HTTPS endpoint to the other {{agents}}

            `elastic-agent-cert`
            :   The certificate to use as the client certificate for {{agent}}'s connections to {{fleet-server}}.

            `elastic-agent-cert-key`
            :   The path to the private key to use as for {{agent}}'s connections to {{fleet-server}}.

            `elastic-agent-cert-key-passphrase`
            :   The path to the file that contains the passphrase for the mutual TLS private key that {{agent}} will use to connect to {{fleet-server}}. The file must only contain the characters of the passphrase, no newline or extra non-printing characters. This option is only used if the `elastic-agent-cert-key` is encrypted and requires a passphrase to use.

            `fleet-server-es-cert`
            :   The path to the client certificate that {{fleet-server}} will use when connecting to {{es}}.

            `fleet-server-es-cert-key`
            :   The path to the private key that {{fleet-server}} will use when connecting to {{es}}.

            `fleet-server-client-auth`
            :   One of `none`, `optional`, or `required`. Defaults to `none`. {{fleet-server}}'s client_authentication option for client mTLS connections. If `optional` or `required` is specified, client certificates are verified using CAs specified in the `--certificate-authorities` flag.

            Additionally an optional passphrase for the private key may be specified with:

            `fleet-server-cert-key-passphrase`
            :   Passphrase file used to decrypt {{fleet-server}}'s private key.

            What happens if you enroll {{fleet-server}} without specifying certificates?
            If the certificates are managed by your organization and installed at the system level, they will be used to encrypt traffic between {{agent}}s, {{fleet-server}}, and {{es}}.
            If system-level certificates don’t exist, {{fleet-server}} automatically generates self-signed certificates. Traffic between {{fleet-server}} and {{agent}}s over HTTPS is encrypted, but the certificate chain cannot be verified. Any {{agent}}s enrolling in {{fleet-server}} will need to pass the `--insecure` flag to acknowledge that the certificate chain is not verified.
            Allowing {{fleet-server}} to generate self-signed certificates is useful to get things running for development, but not recommended in a production environment.


    2. Install your {{agent}}s and enroll them in {{fleet}}.

        {{agent}}s connecting to a secured {{fleet-server}} need to pass in the CA certificate used by the {{fleet-server}}. The CA certificate used by {{es}} is already specified in the agent policy because it’s set under {{fleet}} settings in {{kib}}. You do not need to pass it on the command line.

        The following command installs {{agent}} as a service, enrolls it in the agent policy associated with the specified token, and starts the service.

        ```shell
        sudo elastic-agent install --url=https://192.0.2.1:8220 \
          --enrollment-token=<string> \
          --certificate-authorities=/path/to/ca.crt
        ```

        Where:

        `url`
        :   {{fleet-server}} URL to use to enroll the {{agent}} into {{fleet}}.

        `enrollment-token`
        :   The enrollment token for the policy that will be applied to the {{agent}}.

        `certificate-authorities`
        :   CA certificate to use to connect to {{fleet-server}}. This is the CA used to [generate a certificate and key](#generate-fleet-server-certs) for {{fleet-server}}.

        Don’t have an enrollment token? On the **Agents** tab in {{fleet}}, select **Add agent**. Under **Enroll and start the Elastic Agent**, follow the in-product installation steps, making sure that you add the `--certificate-authorities` option before you run the command.


## Configure SSL/TLS using {{kib}} [fleet-server-ssl-ui-settings]

```{applies_to}
  stack: ga 9.1
```

You can configure SSL/TLS settings for {{fleet-server}} hosts directly in the {{fleet}} UI, without relying on CLI flags or policy overrides.

To access these settings:

1. In **Kibana**, go to **Management > {{fleet}} > Settings**.
2. Under **{{fleet-server}} hosts**, select **Add host** or edit an existing host.
3. Expand the **SSL options** section.

### SSL options

These are the available UI fields and their CLI equivalents:

The following table shows the available UI fields and their CLI equivalents:

| **UI Field**                          | **CLI Flag**                 | **Purpose**                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server SSL certificate authorities    | `--certificate-authorities`  | CA to validate agent certificates (Fleet Server authenticates agent) |
| Client SSL certificate                | `--fleet-server-cert`        | TLS certificate Fleet Server presents to agent (agent validates it)  |
| Client SSL certificate key            | `--fleet-server-cert-key`    | Key paired with the Fleet Server client certificate                  |
| Elasticsearch certificate authorities | `--fleet-server-es-ca`       | CA Fleet Server uses to validate Elasticsearch cert                  |
| SSL certificate for Elasticsearch     | `--fleet-server-es-cert`     | Fleet Server’s mTLS certificate for Elasticsearch                    |
| SSL certificate key for Elasticsearch | `--fleet-server-es-cert-key` | Key paired with the Fleet Server’s Elasticsearch certificate         |
| Enable client authentication          | `--fleet-server-client-auth` | Require agents to present client certificates (mTLS only)                 |

:::{warning}
Editing SSL or proxy settings for an existing {{fleet-server}} might cause agents to lose connectivity. After changing client certificate settings, you might need to re-enroll the affected agents.
:::

To configure a mutual TLS connection from {{fleet-server}} to {{es}}, use the {{es}} output settings. For more information, refer to [Output SSL options](/reference/fleet/tls-overview.md#output-ssl-options).

## Configure advanced SSL/TLS settings for {{fleet-server}} [fleet-server-advanced-ssl-settings]

The {{fleet}} UI and the `elastic-agent install` command cover the most common SSL/TLS settings, such as certificates, certificate authorities, and client authentication. Granular options like the allowed TLS versions (`supported_protocols`) and cipher suites (`cipher_suites`) aren't exposed as UI fields or install command flags. To set them, add a `server.ssl` block to the {{fleet-server}} integration policy's advanced YAML configuration. {{fleet-server}} applies these settings to the HTTPS endpoint that {{agents}} connect to.

To edit the advanced YAML configuration:

1. Find {{fleet}} in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Select the **Agent policies** tab, then select the policy that runs {{fleet-server}}.
3. Open the **Actions** menu {icon}`ellipsis` for the {{fleet-server}} integration, and select **Edit integration**.
4. Expand **Advanced options** in the **Fleet Server** section.
5. In the **Custom fleet-server configurations** field, add a `server.ssl` block with the required SSL configurations. For example:

    ```yaml
    server:
      ssl:
        enabled: true
        supported_protocols:
          - TLSv1.2
          - TLSv1.3
        cipher_suites:
          - ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
          - ECDHE-RSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256
          - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
          - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256
    ```

6. Save the integration to roll out the updated policy to your {{fleet-server}}s.

If you omit `supported_protocols`, {{fleet-server}} allows `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`. If you omit `cipher_suites`, the default cipher suites are used. TLS 1.3 cipher suites can't be configured individually.

For the full list of SSL settings and their allowed values, refer to the server configuration options in [Configure SSL/TLS for standalone {{agents}}](/reference/fleet/elastic-agent-ssl-configuration.md#server-ssl-config-options).

:::{warning}
Editing SSL settings for an existing {{fleet-server}} might cause agents to lose connectivity. If you restrict `supported_protocols` or `cipher_suites` to values that connected {{agents}} don't support, those agents fail to check in. Verify that your chosen protocols and cipher suites are compatible with all connected {{agents}} before you apply the change.
