# Manage {{agent}} integrations [integrations]

{{agent}} integrations provide a simple, unified way to collect data from popular apps and services, and protect systems from security threats.
Integrations are available for a wide array of popular services and platforms. To see the full list, go to the **Integrations** page in {{kib}}, or visit [Elastic Integrations](integration-docs://reference/index.md). 

{{agent}} integrations based on the [Elastic Common Schema](ecs://reference/index.md) (ECS) come prepackaged with assets that support your observability needs:

* Data ingestion, storage, and transformation rules
* Configuration options
* Alert templates to enable users to quickly set up custom alerting rules (available in some integrations) {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2`
* Pre-built, custom dashboards and visualizations
* Documentation

{applies_to}`stack: preview 9.2.0` {{fleet}} also supports installing {{agent}} integration packages for collecting and visualizing OpenTelemetry data. For more information, refer to [Collect OpenTelemetry data with {{agent}} integrations](/reference/fleet/otel-integrations.md).

Note that the **Integrations** app in {{kib}} needs access to the public {{package-registry}} to discover integrations. If your deployment has network restrictions, you can [deploy your own self-managed {{package-registry}}](/reference/fleet/air-gapped.md#air-gapped-diy-epr).

::::{note}
Some integrations may function differently across different spaces, with some working only in the default space. Review the documentation specific to your integration for any space-related considerations.

## Work with integrations [work-with-integrations]

## Customize integrations [customize-integrations]

After you've started using integrations to ingest data, you can customize how the data is managed over time. Refer to [Index lifecycle management](/reference/fleet/data-streams.md#data-streams-ilm) to learn more.
