# Run {{agent}} as an OTel Collector [otel-agent]

[{{agent}}](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/index.md) is an open-source agent that can receive, process, and export telemetry data. {{agent}} includes an embedded OTel Collector that allows you to instrument your applications and infrastructure once, and send data to multiple vendors and backends.

When you run {{agent}} in `otel` mode, it supports the standard OpenTelemetry Collector configuration format that defines a set of receivers, processors, exporters, and connectors. Logs, metrics, and traces can be collected and exported using OpenTelemetry data formats.

For a full overview and steps to configure {{agent}} in `otel` mode, including a guided onboarding, refer to [{{agent}} in OpenTelemetry mode](elastic-agent://reference/edot-collector/index.md). You can also check the [`elastic-agent otel` command](/reference/fleet/agent-command-reference.md#elastic-agent-otel-command) in the {{fleet}} and {{agent}} Command reference.

If you have a currently running {{agent}} you can [transform it to run as an OTel Collector](/reference/fleet/otel-agent-transform.md).
