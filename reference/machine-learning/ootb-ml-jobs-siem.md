# Security {{anomaly-detect}} configurations

These {{anomaly-jobs}} automatically detect file system and network anomalies on your hosts. They appear in the **Anomaly Detection** interface of the {{security-app}} in {{kib}} when you have data that matches their configuration. For more information, refer to [Anomaly detection with machine learning](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/anomaly-detection.md).

::::{note}
:applies_to: {stack: ga 9.4+, serverless: ga}

In {{stack}} 9.4, [Entity Analytics](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics.md) introduces fields for entity resolution. The {{ml-jobs}} created in this version and later are designed to leverage these fields.

* The affected {{ml-jobs}} include an `_ea` suffix in their names, as described in each module below.
* Previously installed {{ml-jobs}} and detection rules continue to run, allowing time to transition to the Entity Analytics fields.
* We recommend that you install the `_ea` {{ml-jobs}} and verify they are collecting data and generating anomalies before upgrading to the latest detection rules included in 9.4.
::::

## Data requirements

To use these anomaly detection jobs, install and configure one of the supported integrations listed in each job's table. No additional configuration is required beyond the integration's standard setup. For installation instructions, refer to each integration's documentation.

## Security: Authentication [security-authentication]

Detect anomalous activity in your ECS-compatible authentication logs.

In the {{ml-app}} app, these configurations are available only when data exists that matches the query specified in the [manifest file](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_auth/manifest.json). In the {{security-app}}, it looks in the {{data-source}} specified in the [`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#securitysolution-defaultindex) for data that matches the query.

By default, when you create these jobs in the {{security-app}}, the job wizard uses a {{data-source}} that applies to multiple indices. If you use {{ml-app}} instead, create a similar [{{data-source}}](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_auth/manifest.json#L7) and select it in the job wizard so the results match.

## Security: Network [security-network-jobs]

Detect anomalous network activity in your ECS-compatible network logs.

In the {{ml-app}} app, these configurations are available only when data exists that matches the query specified in the [manifest file](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/manifest.json). In the {{security-app}}, it looks in the {{data-source}} specified in the [`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#securitysolution-defaultindex) for data that matches the query.

By default, when you create these jobs in the {{security-app}}, the job wizard uses a {{data-source}} that applies to multiple indices. If you use {{ml-app}} instead, create a similar [{{data-source}}](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/manifest.json#L7) and select it in the job wizard so the results match.

`dns_tunneling_ea` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   Looks for unusual DNS activity that could indicate command-and-control or data exfiltration activity.

    **Supported integrations:** [{{elastic-defend}}](integration-docs://reference/endpoint/index.md), [Network Packet Capture](integration-docs://reference/network_traffic/index.md), [Packetbeat](beats://reference/packetbeat/index.md)

    **Supported OS:** Windows, Linux, macOS

    **Job (JSON):** [code](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/ml/dns_tunneling_ea.json)

    **Datafeed:** [code](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/ml/datafeed_dns_tunneling_ea.json)

`high_count_by_destination_country`
:   Looks for an unusually large spike in network activity to one destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.

    **Supported integrations:** [{{elastic-defend}}](integration-docs://reference/endpoint/index.md), [Network Packet Capture](integration-docs://reference/network_traffic/index.md), [Packetbeat](beats://reference/packetbeat/index.md)

    **Supported OS:** Windows, Linux, macOS

    **Job (JSON):** [code](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/x-pack/platform/plugins/shared/ml/server/models/data_recognizer/modules/security_network/ml/high_count_by_destination_country.json)

`high_count_network_denies`
:   Looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network ACLs or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually either 1) a misconfigured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

    **Supported integrations:** [{{elastic-defend}}](integration-docs://reference/endpoint/index.md), [Network Packet Capture](integration-docs://reference/network_traffic/index.md), [Packetbeat](beats://reference/packetbeat/index.md)

`high_count_network_events`
:   Looks for an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity. Large-scale data exfiltration may produce a burst of network traffic; this could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic.  Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.

`rare_destination_country`
:   Looks for an unusual destination country name in the network logs. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from a server in a country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.

## Security: Windows [security-windows-jobs]

Anomaly detection jobs for Windows host-based threat hunting and detection.

## Security: Elastic Integrations [security-integrations-jobs]

[Elastic Integrations](integration-docs://reference/index.md) are a streamlined way to add Elastic assets to your environment, such as data ingestion, transforms, and in this case, {{ml}} capabilities for Security.

The following Integrations use {{ml}} to analyze patterns of user and entity behavior, and help detect and alert when there is related suspicious activity in your environment.

* [Data Exfiltration Detection](integration-docs://reference/ded/index.md)
* [Domain Generation Algorithm Detection](integration-docs://reference/dga/index.md)
* [Lateral Movement Detection](integration-docs://reference/lmd/index.md)
* [Living off the Land Attack Detection](integration-docs://reference/problemchild/index.md)
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` [Privileged Access Detection](integration-docs://reference/pad.md)

### Data Exfiltration Detection (DED)

{{ml-cap}} package to detect data exfiltration in your network and file data. Refer to the [subscription page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) to learn more about the required subscription.

To download, refer to the [documentation](integration-docs://reference/ded/index.md).
