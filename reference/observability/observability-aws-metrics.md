# AWS metrics [observability-aws-metrics]

::::{important}
Additional AWS charges for GetMetricData API requests are generated using this module.

::::

## Monitor EC2 instances [monitor-ec2-instances]

To analyze EC2 instance metrics, you can select view filters based on the following predefined metrics, or you can add [custom metrics](/solutions/observability/infra-and-hosts/view-infrastructure-metrics-by-resource-type.md#custom-metrics).

:::{note}
:applies_to: stack: ga 9.3
For EC2 instances, The [Infrastructure UI](/solutions/observability/infra-and-hosts/analyze-infrastructure-host-metrics.md) and [inventory rules](/solutions/observability/incident-management/create-an-inventory-rule.md) only support metric collected by the [EC2 integration](integration-docs://reference/aws/ec2.md).

### Entity definition [monitor-ec2-entity]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.3
```

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Filter** | `event.module : aws` | Used to filter relevant data. |
| **Identifier** | `cloud.instance.id` | Used to identify each entity. |
| **Display value** | `cloud.instance.name` | Used as a display friendly value. |

### Metrics [monitor-ec2-metrics]

|  |  |

## Monitor S3 buckets [monitor-s3-buckets]

To analyze S3 bucket metrics, you can select view filters based on the following predefined metrics, or you can add [custom metrics](/solutions/observability/infra-and-hosts/view-infrastructure-metrics-by-resource-type.md#custom-metrics).
