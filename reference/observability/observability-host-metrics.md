### Legacy metrics [legacy-metrics]

Over time, we may change the formula used to calculate a specific metric. To avoid affecting your existing rules, instead of changing the actual metric definition, we create a new metric and refer to the old one as "legacy".

The UI and any new rules you create will use the new metric definition. However, any alerts that use the old definition will refer to the metric as "legacy".

| **CPU Usage (legacy)** | Percentage of CPU time spent in states other than Idle and IOWait, normalized by the number of CPU cores. This includes both time spent on user space and kernel space. 100% means all CPUs of the host are busy.<br><br>**Field Calculation**: `(average(system.cpu.user.pct) + average(system.cpu.system.pct)) / max(system.cpu.cores)`<br> |
| **Network Inbound (RX) (legacy)** | Number of bytes that have been received per second on the public interfaces of the hosts.<br><br>**Field Calculation**: `average(host.network.ingress.bytes) * 8 / (max(metricset.period, kql='host.network.ingress.bytes: *') / 1000)`<br> |
| **Network Outbound (TX) (legacy)** | Number of bytes that have been sent per second on the public interfaces of the hosts.<br><br>**Field Calculation**: `average(host.network.egress.bytes) * 8 / (max(metricset.period, kql='host.network.egress.bytes: *') / 1000)`<br> |
