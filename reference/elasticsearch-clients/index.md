# Elasticsearch clients [elasticsearch-clients]

{{es}} is easy to use from most popular programming languages, thanks to the wide range of official libraries and developer tools available.


## Language client overview

## Releases and compatibility

{{es}} client libraries are released for every {{es}} server major or minor release.
Patches are released independently to allow for faster bugfixes.
This release policy does not affect compatibility; for example, version 8.13.x of the client will be compatible with versions of the server 8.13.y where y >= x.

The {{es}} clients are forward compatible, meaning that the client supports communicating with greater or equal minor versions of {{es}} without breaking.
It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features of newer {{es}} versions; that is only possible after the release of a new client version.
For example, an 8.12 client will not automatically support the new features of {{es}} 8.13; the 8.13 client version is required for that.
{{es}} language clients are only backwards compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.

:::{note}
When upgrading {{es}} it is strongly recommended to upgrade the server first, _before_ the client.
The forward compatibility policy allows client applications to continue to work with the new server before the client itself is upgraded.

## Local server development

For development and testing on a local {{es}} server, [start-local](https://github.com/elastic/start-local) is recommended:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

Alternatively, learn how to [connect to your {{es}} endpoint](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project/search-connection-details.md) for other types of deployment.
