Follow along to set up your ((es)) project and get started with some sample documents.
Then, choose how to continue with your own data.

## Create project

Use your ((ecloud)) account to create a fully-managed ((es)) project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](((ess-console))) and create a new account or log in to your existing account.
1. Within **Serverless Projects**, choose **Create project**.
1. Choose the ((es)) project type.
1. Select a **configuration** for your project, based on your use case.
     - **General purpose**. For general search use cases across various data types.
     - **Optimized for Vectors**. For search use cases using vectors and near real-time retrieval.
1. Provide a name for the project and optionally edit the project settings, such as the cloud platform <DocLink slug="/serverless/regions" text="region"/>.
   Select **Create project** to continue.
1. Once the project is ready, select **Continue**.

You should now see **Get started with ((es))**, and you're ready to continue.

## Create API key

Create an API key, which will enable you to access the ((es)) API to ingest and search data.

1. Scroll to **Add an API Key** and select **New**.
1. In **Create API Key**, enter a name for your key and (optionally) set an expiration date.
1. (Optional) Under **Control Security privileges**, you can set specific access permissions for this API key. By default, it has full access to all APIs.
1. (Optional) The **Add metadata** section allows you to add custom key-value pairs to help identify and organize your API keys.
1. Select **Create API Key** to finish.

After creation, you'll see your API key displayed as an encoded string.
Store this encoded API key securely. It is displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later.
You will use this encoded API key when sending API requests.

<DocCallOut>
  You can't recover or retrieve a lost API key. Instead, you must delete the key and create a new one.
</DocCallOut>

## Copy URL

Next, copy the URL of your API endpoint.
You'll send all ((es)) API requests to this URL.

1. Scroll to **Copy your connection details**.
1. Find the value for **Elasticsearch Endpoint**.

Store this value along with your `encoded` API key.
You'll use both values in the next step.

## Test connection

We'll use the `curl` command to test your connection and make additional API requests.
(See [Install curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) if you need to install this program.)

`curl` will need access to your Elasticsearch Endpoint and `encoded` API key.
Within your terminal, assign these values to the `ES_URL` and `API_KEY` environment variables.

For example:

```bash
export ES_URL="https://dda7de7f1d264286a8fc9741c7741690.es.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud:443"
export API_KEY="ZFZRbF9Jb0JDMEoxaVhoR2pSa3Q6dExwdmJSaldRTHFXWEp4TFFlR19Hdw=="
```

Then run the following command to test your connection:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "name" : "serverless",
  "cluster_name" : "dda7de7f1d264286a8fc9741c7741690",
  "cluster_uuid" : "ws0IbTBUQfigmYAVMztkZQ",
  "version" : { ... },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Now you're ready to ingest and search some sample documents.

## Ingest data

<DocCallOut>
  This example uses ((es)) APIs to ingest data. If you'd prefer to upload a file using the UI, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/ingest-data-file-upload" />.
</DocCallOut>

To ingest data, you must create an index and store some documents.
This process is also called "indexing".

You can index multiple documents using a single `POST` request to the `_bulk` API endpoint.
The request body specifies the documents to store and the indices in which to store them.

((es)) will automatically create the index and map each document value to one of its data types.
Include the `?pretty` option to receive a human-readable response.

Run the following command to index some sample documents into the `books` index:

```bash
curl -X POST "${ES_URL}/_bulk?pretty" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Snow Crash", "author": "Neal Stephenson", "release_date": "1992-06-01", "page_count": 470}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Revelation Space", "author": "Alastair Reynolds", "release_date": "2000-03-15", "page_count": 585}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 328}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Fahrenheit 451", "author": "Ray Bradbury", "release_date": "1953-10-15", "page_count": 227}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley", "release_date": "1932-06-01", "page_count": 268}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "books" } }
{"name": "The Handmaids Tale", "author": "Margaret Atwood", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 311}
'
```

You should receive a response indicating there were no errors:

```json
{
  "errors" : false,
  "took" : 1260,
  "items" : [ ... ]
}
```

## Search data

To search, send a `POST` request to the `_search` endpoint, specifying the index to search.
Use the ((es)) query DSL to construct your request body.

Run the following command to search the `books` index for documents containing `snow`:

```bash
curl -X POST "${ES_URL}/books/_search?pretty" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "snow"
    }
  }
}
'
```

You should receive a response with the results:

```json
{
  "took" : 24,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.5904956,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "books",
        "_id" : "Z3hf_IoBONQ5TXnpLdlY",
        "_score" : 1.5904956,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Snow Crash",
          "author" : "Neal Stephenson",
          "release_date" : "1992-06-01",
          "page_count" : 470
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Continue on your own

Congratulations!
You've set up an ((es)) project, and you've ingested and searched some sample data.
Now you're ready to continue on your own.

### Explore

Want to explore the sample documents or your own data?

By creating a data view, you can explore data using several UI tools, such as Discover or Dashboards. Or, use ((es)) aggregations to explore your data using the API. Find more information in <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/explore-your-data" />.

### Build

Ready to build your own solution?

To learn more about sending and syncing data to ((es)), or the search API and its query DSL, check <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/ingest-your-data" /> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/http-apis" />.
