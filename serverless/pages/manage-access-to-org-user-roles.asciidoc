= Assign user roles and privileges

// :description: Manage the predefined set of roles and privileges for all your projects.
// :keywords: serverless, general, organization, roles, how to

Within an organization, users can have one or more roles and each role grants specific privileges.

You must assign user roles when you <<general-manage-access-to-organization,invite users to join your organization>>.
To subsequently edit the roles assigned to a user:

. Go to the user icon on the header bar and select **Organization**.
. Find the user on the **Members** tab of the **Organization** page. Click the member name to view and edit its roles.

== Organization-level roles

* **Organization owner**. Can manage all roles under the organization and has full access to all serverless projects, organization-level details, billing details, and subscription levels. This role is assigned by default to the person who created the organization.
* **Billing admin**. Has access to all invoices and payment methods. Can make subscription changes.

== Instance access roles

Each serverless project type has a set of predefined roles that you can assign to your organization members.
You can assign the predefined roles:

* globally, for all projects of the same type ({es-serverless}, {observability}, or {elastic-sec}). In this case, the role will also apply to new projects created later.
* individually, for specific projects only. To do that, you have to set the **Role for all** field of that specific project type to **None**.

For example, you can assign a user the developer role for a specific {es-serverless} project:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/individual-role.png[Individual role]

ifdef::serverlessCustomRoles[]

You can also optionally <<custom-roles,create custom roles in a project>>.
To assign a custom role to users, go to "Instance access roles" and select it from the list under the specific project it was created in.
