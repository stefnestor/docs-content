= Deploy the model in your cluster

// :description: Description to be written

After you import the model and vocabulary, you can use {kib} to view and
manage their deployment across your cluster under **{ml-app}** →
**Model Management**. Alternatively, you can use the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API].

You can deploy a model multiple times by assigning a unique deployment ID when
starting the deployment. It enables you to have dedicated deployments for
different purposes, such as search and ingest. By doing so, you ensure that the
search speed remains unaffected by ingest workloads, and vice versa. Having
separate deployments for search and ingest mitigates performance issues
resulting from interactions between the two, which can be hard to diagnose.

It is recommended to fine-tune each deployment based on its specific purpose. To
improve ingest performance, increase throughput by adding more allocations to
the deployment. For improved search speed, increase the number of threads per
allocation.

[NOTE]
====
Since eland uses APIs to deploy the models, you cannot see the models in
{kib} until the saved objects are synchronized. You can follow the prompts in
{kib}, wait for automatic synchronization, or use the
{kibana-ref}/machine-learning-api-sync.html[sync {ml} saved objects API].
====

When you deploy the model, its allocations are distributed across available {ml}
nodes. Model allocations are independent units of work for NLP tasks. To
influence model performance, you can configure the number of allocations and the
number of threads used by each allocation of your deployment.

Throughput can be scaled by adding more allocations to the deployment; it
increases the number of {infer} requests that can be performed in parallel. All
allocations assigned to a node share the same copy of the model in memory. The
model is loaded into memory in a native process that encapsulates `libtorch`,
which is the underlying {ml} library of PyTorch. The number of allocations
setting affects the amount of model allocations across all the {ml} nodes. Model
allocations are distributed in such a way that the total number of used threads
does not exceed the allocated processors of a node.

The threads per allocation setting affects the number of threads used by each
model allocation during {infer}. Increasing the number of threads generally
increases the speed of {infer} requests. The value of this setting must not
exceed the number of available allocated processors per node.

You can view the allocation status in {kib} or by using the
{ref}/get-trained-models-stats.html[get trained model stats API]. If you want to
change the number of allocations, you can use the
{ref}/update-trained-model-deployment.html[update trained model stats API]
after the allocation status is `started`.

[[request-queues-and-search-priority]]
== Request queues and search priority

Each allocation of a model deployment has a dedicated queue to buffer {infer}
requests. The size of this queue is determined by the `queue_capacity` parameter
in the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API].
When the queue reaches its maximum capacity, new requests are declined until
some of the queued requests are processed, creating available capacity once
again. When multiple ingest pipelines reference the same deployment, the queue
can fill up, resulting in rejected requests. Consider using dedicated
deployments to prevent this situation.

{infer-cap} requests originating from search, such as the
{ref}/query-dsl-sparse-vector-query.html[`sparse_vector` query], have a higher
priority compared to non-search requests. The {infer} ingest processor generates
normal priority requests. If both a search query and an ingest processor use the
same deployment, the search requests with higher priority skip ahead in the
queue for processing before the lower priority ingest requests. This
prioritization accelerates search responses while potentially slowing down
ingest where response time is less critical.
