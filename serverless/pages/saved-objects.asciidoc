## Required permissions

To access **Saved Objects**, you must have the required `Saved Objects Management` {kib} privilege.

To add the privilege, open the main menu, and then click **Management → Roles**.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Granting access to `Saved Objects Management` authorizes users to
manage all saved objects in {kib}, including objects that are managed by
applications they may not otherwise be authorized to access.

[[saved-objects-import-and-export]]
== Import and export

Use import and export to move objects between different {kib} instances.
These actions are useful when you have multiple environments for development and production.
Import and export also work well when you have a large number of objects to update and want to batch the process.

////
/*
TBD: Do these APIs exist for serverless?
{kib} also provides <DocLink id="enKibanaSavedObjectsApiImport">import</DocLink> and
<DocLink id="enKibanaSavedObjectsApiExport">export</DocLink> APIs to automate this process.

/*
TBD: Are these settings configurable in serverless?
<DocCallOut title="Note">
The <DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="savedObjects-maxImportExportSize">`savedObjects.maxImportExportSize`</DocLink> configuration setting
limits the number of saved objects to include in the file. The
<DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="savedObjects-maxImportPayloadBytes">`savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes`</DocLink> setting limits the overall
size of the file that you can import.
</DocCallOut>

=== Export

Export objects by selection or type.
