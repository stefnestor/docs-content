<DocBadge template="technical preview" />

Some features that are available in Elastic Cloud Hosted and self-managed offerings are not available in serverless ((es)). 
These features have either been replaced by a new feature, or are not applicable in the new Serverless architecture:

- **Index lifecycle management (((ilm-init)))** is not available, in favor of **<DocLink slug="/serverless/index-management" section="manage-data-streams" 
text="data stream lifecycle"/>**. 

  In an Elastic Cloud Hosted or self-managed environment, ((ilm-init)) lets you automatically transition indices through data tiers according to your 
  performance needs and retention requirements. This allows you to balance hardware costs with performance. Serverless Elasticsearch eliminates this 
  complexity by optimizing your cluster performance for you. 
  
  Data stream lifecycle is an optimized lifecycle tool that lets you focus on the most common lifecycle management needs, without unnecessary 
  hardware-centric concepts like data tiers.
  <br/>
- **Watcher** is not available, in favor of **<DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/explore-your-data-alerting" text="Kibana Alerts"/>**. 

  Kibana Alerts allows rich integrations across use cases like APM, metrics, security, and uptime. Prepackaged rule types simplify setup and 
  hide the details of complex, domain-specific detections, while providing a consistent interface across Kibana.
  <br/>
- Certain APIs, API parameters, index, cluster and node level settings are not available. Refer to our 
  <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/http-apis" text="REST API references"/> for a list of available APIs.

  Serverless Elasticsearch manages the underlying Elastic cluster for you, optimizing nodes, shards, and replicas for your use case. 
  Because of this, various management and monitoring APIs, API parameters and settings are not available on Serverless.
