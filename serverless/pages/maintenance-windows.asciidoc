You can schedule single or recurring {maint-windows} to temporarily reduce rule notifications.
For example, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during planned outages.

Alerts continue to be generated, however notifications are suppressed as follows:

* When an alert occurs during a maintenance window, there are no notifications.
When the alert recovers, there are no notifications--even if the recovery occurs after the maintenance window ends.
* When an alert occurs before a maintenance window and recovers during or after the maintenance window, notifications are sent as usual.

## Configure access to maintenance windows

To use maintenance windows, you must have the appropriate [subscription]({subscriptions}) and {kib} feature privileges.

- To have full access to maintenance windows, you must have `All` privileges for the **Management → Maintenance Windows*** feature.
- To have view-only access to maintenance windows, you must have `Read` privileges for the **Management → Maintenance Windows* feature.

== Create and manage {maint-windows}

In **{project-settings} → {manage-app} → {maint-windows-app}** you can create, edit, and archive {maint-windows}.

When you create a maintenance window, you must provide a name and a schedule.
You can optionally configure it to repeat daily, monthly, yearly, or on a custom interval.

If you turn on **Filter alerts**, you can use KQL to filter the alerts affected by the maintenance window.
For example, you can suppress notifications for alerts from specific rules:

[NOTE]
====
* You can select only a single category when you turn on filters.
* Some rules are not affected by maintenance window filters because their alerts do not contain requisite data.
In particular, {kibana-ref}/kibana-alerts.html[{stack-monitor-app}], {kibana-ref}/geo-alerting.html[tracking containment], {ml-docs}/ml-configuring-alerts.html[{anomaly-jobs} health], and {ref}/transform-alerts.html[transform health] rules are not affected by the filters.
====

A maintenance window can have any one of the following statuses:

* `Upcoming`: It will run at the scheduled date and time.
* `Running`: It is running.
* `Finished`: It ended and does not have a repeat schedule.
* `Archived`: It is archived. In a future release, archived {maint-windows} will be queued for deletion.

When you view alert details in {kib}, each alert shows unique identifiers for {maint-windows} that affected it.
