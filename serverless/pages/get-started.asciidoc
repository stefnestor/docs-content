[[elasticsearch-follow-guided-index-flow]]
== Option 1: Follow the guided index flow

Once your project is set up, you'll be directed to a page where you can create your first index. 
An index is where documents are stored and organized, making it possible to search and retrieve data.

. Enter a name for your index.
. Click *Create my index*. You can also create the index by clicking on *Code* to view and run code through the command line.

. You’ll be directed to the *Index Management* page. Here, copy and save the following:
- Elasticsearch URL
- API key

[NOTE]
====
You won’t be able to view this API key again. If needed, refer to <<elasticsearch-get-started-create-api-key,Create a new API key>> to generate a new one.
====

The UI provides ready-to-use code examples for ingesting data via the REST API. 
Choose your preferred tool for making these requests:

* <<devtools-run-api-requests-in-the-console, Console>> in your project's UI
* Python 
* JavaScript 
* cURL
