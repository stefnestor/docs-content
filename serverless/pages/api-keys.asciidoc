// :description: API keys allow access to the {stack} on behalf of a user.
// :keywords: serverless, Elasticsearch, Observability, Security

This content applies to: {es-badge} {obs-badge} {sec-badge}

API keys are security mechanisms used to authenticate and authorize access to {stack} resources,
and ensure that only authorized users or applications are able to interact with the {stack}.

For example, if you extract data from an {es} cluster on a daily basis, you might create an API key tied to your credentials, configure it with minimum access, and then put the API credentials into a cron job.
Or, you might create API keys to automate ingestion of new data from remote sources, without a live user interaction.

You can manage your keys in **{project-settings} → {manage-app} → {api-keys-app}**:

// TBD: This image was refreshed but should be automated

A _personal API key_ allows external services to access the {stack} on behalf of a user.

// Cross-Cluster API key: allows remote clusters to connect to your local cluster.

A _managed API key_ is created and managed by {kib} to correctly run background tasks.

// TBD (accurate?) Secondary credentials have the same or lower access rights.

////
/* ## Security privileges

You must have the `manage_security`, `manage_api_key`, or the `manage_own_api_key`
cluster privileges to use API keys in Elastic.  API keys can also be seen in a readonly view with access to the page and the `read_security` cluster privilege. To manage roles, open the main menu, then click
**Management → Custom Roles**, or use the <DocLink id="enKibanaRoleManagementApi">Role Management API</DocLink>.  */

[[api-keys-create-an-api-key]]
== Create an API key

In **{api-keys-app}**, click **Create API key**:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-personal-api-key.png["Create API key UI"]

Once created, you can copy the encoded API key and use it to send requests to the {es} HTTP API. For example:

[source,bash]
----
curl "${ES_URL}" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
API keys are intended for programmatic access. Don't use API keys to
authenticate access using a web browser.

[[api-keys-restrict-privileges]]
=== Restrict privileges

When you create or update an API key, use **Restrict privileges** to limit the permissions. Define the permissions using a JSON `role_descriptors` object, where you specify one or more roles and the associated privileges.

For example, the following `role_descriptors` object defines a `books-read-only` role that limits the API key to `read` privileges on the `books` index.

[source,json]
----
{
  "books-read-only": {
    "cluster": [],
    "indices": [
      {
        "names": ["books"],
        "privileges": ["read"]
      }
    ],
    "applications": [],
    "run_as": [],
    "metadata": {},
    "transient_metadata": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
----

For the `role_descriptors` object schema, check out the {ref}/security-api-create-api-key.html#security-api-create-api-key-request-body[`/_security/api_key` endpoint] docs. For supported privileges, check {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Security privileges].

[[api-keys-update-an-api-key]]
== Update an API key

In **{api-keys-app}**, click on the name of the key.
You can update only **Restrict privileges** and **Include metadata**.

// TBD: Refer to the update API key documentation to learn more about updating personal API keys.

[[api-keys-view-and-delete-api-keys]]
== View and delete API keys

The **{api-keys-app}** app lists your API keys, including the name, date created, and status.
When API keys expire, the status changes from `Active` to `Expired`.

////
/*
TBD: RBAC requirements for serverless?
If you have `manage_security` or `manage_api_key` permissions,
you can view the API keys of all users, and see which API key was
created by which user in which realm.
If you have only the `manage_own_api_key` permission, you see only a list of your own keys. */
////

You can delete API keys individually or in bulk.
