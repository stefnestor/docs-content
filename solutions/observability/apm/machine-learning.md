# Integrate with {{ml}} [observability-apm-integrate-with-machine-learning]

::::{important}
Using {{ml}} requires an [appropriate license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

::::

The {{ml}} integration initiates a new job predefined to calculate anomaly scores on {{product.apm}} transaction durations. With this integration, you can quickly pinpoint anomalous transactions and identify services with active anomalies across your architecture.

{{ml}} jobs are created per environment and are based on a service’s average response time. Because jobs are created at the environment level, you can add new services to your existing environments without the need for additional {{ml}} jobs.

Results from {{ml}} jobs are shown in multiple places throughout the Applications UI:

* The **Services** inventory provides a quick-glance view of the general health of all of your services. {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Services are color coded to show services with active anomalies so you can quickly identify problem areas.
* The transaction duration chart shows the expected bounds and adds an annotation when the anomaly score is 75 or above.
* Service Maps display a color-coded anomaly indicator on each service node based on the detected anomaly score.
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Alert detail pages for {{product.apm}} anomaly alerts show RED metric charts and the service map, along with [a severity-colored callout](/solutions/observability/apm/service-map.md#service-maps-legend-anomaly-colors) identifying the anomaly type. For more information, refer to [View alerts](/solutions/observability/incident-management/view-alerts.md).

## Enable {{anomaly-detect}} [observability-apm-integrate-with-machine-learning-enable-anomaly-detection]

To enable {{ml}} {{anomaly-detect}}:

1. In your {{obs-serverless}} project or {{kib}}, go to any **Applications** page.
2. Click **{{anomaly-detect-cap}}**.
3. Click **Create Job**.
4. {{ml-jobs-cap}} are created at the environment level. Select all of the service environments that you want to enable {{anomaly-detect}} in. Anomalies will surface for all services and transaction types within the selected environments.
5. Click **Create Jobs**.

After a few minutes, the job will begin calculating results; it might take additional time for results to appear on your service maps. To manage existing jobs, click **Manage jobs** (or go to **{{ml-cap}}** → **Jobs**).

## {{anomaly-detect-cap}} warning [observability-apm-integrate-with-machine-learning-anomaly-detection-warning]

To make {{ml}} as easy as possible to set up, Elastic will warn you when filtered to an environment without a {{ml}} job.

## No anomaly data showing [observability-apm-integrate-with-machine-learning-unknown-service-health]

After enabling {{anomaly-detect}}, anomaly indicators might not appear for a service. Here are some reasons why this can occur:

1. No {{ml}} job exists. Refer to [Enable {{anomaly-detect}}](/solutions/observability/apm/machine-learning.md#observability-apm-integrate-with-machine-learning-enable-anomaly-detection) to enable {{anomaly-detect}} and create an {{ml}} job.
2. There is no {{ml}} data for the job. If you just created the {{ml}} job you’ll need to wait a few minutes for data to be available. Alternatively, if the service or its environment are new, you’ll need to wait for more trace data.
3. No "request" or "page-load" transaction type exists for this service; {{anomaly-detect}} is only available for these transaction types.
