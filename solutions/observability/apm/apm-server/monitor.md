# Monitor APM Server [apm-monitor-apm]

Use the {{stack}} {{monitor-features}} to gain insight into the real-time health and performance of APM Server. Stack monitoring exposes key metrics, like intake response count, intake error rate, output event rate, output failed event rate, and more.

Select your deployment method to get started:

* [{{ecloud}}](#apm-monitor-apm-cloud)
* [Fleet-managed](/solutions/observability/apm/apm-server/monitor-fleet-managed.md)
* [APM Server binary](/solutions/observability/apm/apm-server/monitor-binary.md)

## {{ecloud}} [apm-monitor-apm-cloud]

{{ecloud}} manages the installation and configuration of a monitoring agent for you — so all you have to do is flip a switch and watch the data pour in.

* **{{ech}}** user? See [Stack Monitoring on {{ecloud}} deployments](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/ece-ech-stack-monitoring.md).
* **{{ece}}** user? See [Enable stack monitoring on ECE deployments](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/ece-ech-stack-monitoring.md).
