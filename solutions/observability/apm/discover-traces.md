# Explore traces in Discover [explore-traces-discover]

:::{important}
This functionality is experimental. It may change or be removed at anytime.
:::

**Discover** offers a dedicated experience for exploring trace data. When **Discover** detects data in `traces-*` indices, it automatically enables features that help you investigate distributed traces more effectively. The traces experience includes a preselected set of trace fields in the data grid, a structured overview of each document's key attributes, latency comparisons for similar spans, and a waterfall visualization of the full trace timeline.

If you're just getting started with **Discover** and want to learn its main principles, you should get familiar with the [default experience](/explore-analyze/discover.md).

## Requirements [traces-discover-requirements]

### Data recognition [traces-data-recognition]

Data stored in `traces-*` indices is automatically recognized as trace data and triggers the **Discover** experience described on this page.

### Required {{kib}} privileges [traces-kibana-privileges]

Viewing trace data in **Discover** requires at least `read` privileges for **Discover**.

For more information, refer to [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).

## Load trace data [load-trace-data]

The traces experience is available in:

* **{{data-source-cap}} mode**: Select a {{data-source}} that matches a `traces-*` index pattern from the **Discover** main page.

* **{{esql}} mode**: Switch to **{{esql}}** mode and use the `FROM` command to query your trace data:

    ```esql
    FROM traces-*
    ```

    You can also query a specific index:

    ```esql
    FROM traces-apm-default
    ```

## Traces-specific features [traces-specific-features]

When **Discover** recognizes trace data, it preselects a set of relevant fields as columns in the data grid: `service.name`, `transaction.name`, `span.name`, `transaction.duration.us`, `span.duration.us`, and `event.outcome`. You can [reorder or resize these columns](/explore-analyze/discover/document-explorer.md#document-explorer-columns), or add new ones, using the standard **Discover** column controls.

### Overview charts ({{esql}}) [traces-overview-charts]

In {{esql}} mode, **Discover** displays three summary charts above the results:

- **Latency**: Average response time over the selected time range.
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed trace events over time.
- **Throughput**: Number of trace events per unit of time.

### Trace document overview [trace-document-overview]

Select {icon}`expand` in any row to open the document detail panel. The **Overview** tab shows the key attributes of the selected trace document:

- **Span ID** and **Span name**: Identify the specific operation.
- **Trace ID**: Links all documents that belong to the same trace.
- **Service name**: The service that generated this span.
- **Duration**: How long the operation took, and what percentage of the total trace duration it represents.
- **Start time**: When the operation started.
- **Type** and **Subtype**: The category of the operation, for example `db` / `postgresql` or `external` / `http`.

### Similar spans [similar-spans]

The **Similar spans** section shows a latency chart for spans with the same type and name across your data. Use this view to compare the selected span's performance against historical samples and identify outliers.

Select **Open in Discover** to open a filtered view of all similar spans.

### Trace summary [trace-waterfall]

The **Trace summary** section shows a condensed waterfall of the trace the selected document belongs to. Each row represents a span or transaction, positioned on a timeline to show when it started and how long it took.

Select **Expand trace timeline** to open the expanded waterfall view.

#### Expanded trace timeline [expanded-trace-timeline]

The expanded trace timeline shows all spans and transactions in a trace in a dedicated flyout waterfall view. A color-coded legend identifies which service each span belongs to. Failed spans are highlighted to help you quickly locate errors.

:::{tip}
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.4+
serverless: preview
```
Toggle **Show critical path** to highlight the sequence of spans that determined the trace's total duration.

### Logs [traces-logs]

The **Logs** section shows log entries correlated with the selected trace. Select **Open in Discover** to explore those logs in context.
