# Scale and architect a Synthetics deployment [synthetics-scale-and-architect]

Use these advanced considerations when you use the {{synthetics-app}} for large and complex use cases.

## View monitor data from remote clusters [synthetics-ccs-settings]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.5+
serverless: unavailable
```

Previously, the Synthetics UI couldn’t display data from remote clusters through {{ccs-init}}/{{ccr-init}}, so this setup was discouraged. However, synthetics now includes a built-in {{ccs}} integration that lets you view monitor data from remote {{es}} clusters alongside your local monitors, directly in the Synthetics UI.

This view is read-only, meaning that the integration queries each remote cluster’s `synthetics-*` data indices at query time, but monitor definitions and settings stay as saved objects on the {{kib}} where they were created (saved objects aren’t shared across clusters). To create, edit, or delete those monitors, manage them directly in the Synthetics UI on the remote {{kib}}.

To enable it, go to **{{synthetics-app}} → Settings → Remote clusters**. You can select which remote clusters to query and which {{kib}} spaces the settings apply to. Refer to [Remote clusters](/solutions/observability/synthetics/configure-settings.md#synthetics-settings-remote-clusters) for details.

## Do not use the Synthetics UI with {{ccs-init}}/{{ccr-init}} [synthetics-no-ccs-ccr]
```{applies_to}
stack: removed 9.5+
serverless: unavailable
```

Do not use {{ccs}} ({{ccs-init}}) or {{ccr}} ({{ccr-init}}) to federate Synthetics data across deployments. The Synthetics UI manages monitors and settings as {{kib}} saved objects. Because these saved objects are not shared using {{ccs-init}} or {{ccr-init}}, the Synthetics UI doesn't show remote monitor data when you configure {{ccs-init}} or {{ccr-init}} directly. Use the {{synthetics-app}} on the cluster where the monitors are defined.

You can, however, use [Dashboards](/explore-analyze/dashboards.md) or [Discover](/explore-analyze/discover.md) with {{ccs-init}} to query `synthetics-*` indices directly.

## Synthetics UI does not support autodiscovery for infrastructure or {{k8s}} monitoring [synthetics-no-autodiscovery-for-k8s-infra]

The {{synthetics-app}} is designed for active synthetic checks against user-defined URLs and user journeys. It is not intended for infrastructure or {{k8s}} pod monitoring through autodiscovery.

The Synthetics UI only shows monitors that are explicitly created and managed through the [Synthetics UI](/solutions/observability/synthetics/create-monitors-ui.md) or a [Synthetics project](/solutions/observability/synthetics/create-monitors-with-projects.md). It has no mechanism for dynamic autodiscovery of infrastructure targets, and it is not designed to ingest or display the high volume of short-lived monitor results that infrastructure monitoring typically produces.

For infrastructure or {{k8s}} uptime monitoring, use one of the following approaches instead:

* **[{{heartbeat}}](beats://reference/heartbeat/index.md) with autodiscovery**: Run {{heartbeat}} on your infrastructure and use [autodiscovery](beats://reference/heartbeat/configuration-autodiscover.md) to dynamically monitor hosts and pods. Results appear in the [{{uptime-app}}](/solutions/observability/uptime/index.md).
* **{{agent}} with the Uptime Monitors integration**: Deploy a standalone {{agent}} and configure the Uptime Monitors ({{heartbeat}}) integration to collect availability data from your infrastructure. The {{uptime-app}} is deprecated as of 8.15 and is not available in {{serverless-short}}.

## Manage large numbers of Synthetic monitors with tags [synthetics-tagging]

When you manage larger numbers of synthetic monitors, use tags to keep them organized. Many of the views in the Synthetics UI are tag-aware and can group data by tag.

## Create custom dashboards [synthetics-custom-dashboards]

If the {{synthetics-app}} doesn't include a UI for your exact needs, you can use [dashboards](/explore-analyze/dashboards.md) to build custom visualizations. For a complete list of fields used by the Synthetics UI, refer to [{{heartbeat}}'s exported fields](beats://reference/heartbeat/exported-fields.md).
