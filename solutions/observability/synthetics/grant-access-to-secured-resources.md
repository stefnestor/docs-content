# Grant users access to secured resources [observability-synthetics-feature-roles]

::::{applies-switch}

:::{applies-item} stack:

Typically you need to create the following separate roles:

* [Setup role](/solutions/observability/synthetics/setup-role.md) for enabling Monitor Management.
* [Writer role](/solutions/observability/synthetics/writer-role.md)  for creating, modifying, and deleting monitors.
* [Reader role](/solutions/observability/synthetics/reader-role.md) for {{kib}} users who need to view and create visualizations that access Synthetics data.

{{es-security-features}} provides [built-in roles](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md) that grant a subset of the privileges needed by Synthetics users. When possible, assign users the built-in roles to minimize the affect of future changes on your security strategy. If no built-in role is available, you can assign users the privileges needed to accomplish a specific task.

In general, you'll work with the following privilege types:

* **{{es}} cluster privileges**: Manage the actions a user can perform against your cluster.
* **{{es}} index privileges**: Control access to the data in specific indices your cluster.
* **{{kib}} space privileges**: Grant users write or read access to features and apps within {{kib}}.
