# Explore logs [monitor-logs]

From Discover in {{kib}} or your Observability Serverless project, you can search, filter, and tail all your logs ingested into {{es}}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in Discover.

Discover allows you to quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization. Refer to [Explore logs in Discover](discover-logs.md) for more.

Elastic also provides {{ml}} to detect specific [log anomalies](inspect-log-anomalies.md) automatically and [categorize log messages](categorize-log-entries.md) to quickly identify patterns in your log events.
