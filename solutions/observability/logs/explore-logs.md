# Explore logs [monitor-logs]

Logs Explorer in {{kib}} enables you to search, filter, and tail all your logs ingested into {{es}}. Instead of having to log into different servers, change directories, and tail individual files, all your logs are available in Logs Explorer.

Logs Explorer allows you to quickly search and filter your log data, get information about the structure of log fields, and display your findings in a visualization. Refer to the [Logs Explorer](logs-explorer.md) documentation for more on using Logs Explorer.

Logs Explorer also provides {{ml}} to detect specific [log anomalies](inspect-log-anomalies.md) automatically and [categorize log messages](categorize-log-entries.md) to quickly identify patterns in your log events.

To view Logs Explorer, find **Logs Explorer** in the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md))
