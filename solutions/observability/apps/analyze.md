# Analyze [uptime-analyze]

::::{admonition} Deprecated in 8.15.0.
:class: warning

Use [Synthetic monitoring](/solutions/observability/apps/synthetic-monitoring.md) instead of the {{uptime-app}}.
::::

The {{uptime-app}} in {{kib}} both gives you a high-level overview of your service’s availability and allows you to dig into details to diagnose what caused downtime.

Learn how to view and interpret data in the {{uptime-app}}:

* [View monitor status](view-monitor-status.md)
* [Analyze monitors](analyze-monitors.md)
* [Inspect uptime duration anomalies](inspect-uptime-duration-anomalies.md)
