# Process documents [streams-extract-fields]

After selecting a stream, use the **Processing** tab to add [processors](#streams-extract-processors) and [conditions](#streams-add-processor-conditions) that modify your documents and extract meaningful fields, so you can filter and analyze your data more effectively.

For example, in [Discover](../../../../explore-analyze/discover.md), extracted fields might let you filter for log messages with an `ERROR` log level that occurred during a specific time period to help diagnose an issue. Without extracting the log level and timestamp fields from your messages, those filters wouldn't return meaningful results.

The **Processing** tab also has the following features:

- {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3+` [Generate pipeline suggestions](#streams-generate-pipeline-suggestions).
- Simulate your processors and provide an immediate [preview](#streams-preview-changes) that's tested end to end.
- Flag indexing issues, like [mapping conflicts](#streams-processing-mapping-conflicts), so you can address them before applying changes.

After creating your processor, Streams parses all future data ingested into the stream into structured fields accordingly.

:::{note}
Applied changes aren't retroactive and only affect *future ingested data*.
:::

## Supported processors [streams-extract-processors]

Streams supports the following processors:

- [**Append**](./extract/append.md): Adds a value to an existing array field, or creates the field as an array if it doesn't exist.
- [**Concat**](./extract/concat.md): Concatenates a mix of field values and literal strings into a single field.
- [**Convert**](./extract/convert.md): Converts a field in the currently ingested document to a different type, such as converting a string to an integer.
- [**Date**](./extract/date.md): Converts date strings into timestamps, with options for timezone, locale, and output formatting.
- [**Dissect**](./extract/dissect.md): Extracts fields from structured log messages using defined delimiters instead of patterns, making it faster than Grok and ideal for consistently formatted logs.
- [**Drop**](./extract/drop.md): Drops the document without raising any errors. This is useful to prevent the document from getting indexed based on a condition.
- [**Enrich**](./extract/enrich.md): Adds data from an enrich policy to incoming documents, such as geographic coordinates from an IP address or account details from a user ID.
- [**Grok**](./extract/grok.md): Extracts fields from unstructured log messages using predefined or custom patterns, supports multiple match attempts in sequence, and can automatically generate patterns with an [LLM connector](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/llm-connectors.md).
- [**Join**](./extract/join.md): Concatenates the values of multiple fields with a delimiter.
- [**Lowercase**](./extract/lowercase.md): Converts a string field to lowercase.
- [**Math**](./extract/math.md): Evaluates arithmetic or logical expressions.
- [**Network direction**](./extract/network-direction.md): Determines network traffic direction based on source and destination IP addresses.
- [**Redact**](./extract/redact.md): Redacts sensitive data in a string field by matching grok patterns.
- [**Remove**](./extract/remove.md): Removes existing fields or removes fields by prefix.
- [**Rename**](./extract/rename.md): Changes the name of a field, moving its value to a new field name and removing the original.
- [**Replace**](./extract/replace.md): Replaces parts of a string field according to a regular expression pattern with a replacement string.
- [**Set**](./extract/set.md): Assigns a specific value to a field, creating the field if it doesn't exist or overwriting its value if it does.
- [**Trim**](./extract/trim.md): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string field.
- [**Uppercase**](./extract/uppercase.md): Converts a string field to uppercase.

### Processor limitations and inconsistencies [streams-processor-inconsistencies]

Streams exposes a [Streamlang](./streamlang.md) configuration, but internally it relies on {{es}} ingest pipeline processors and ES|QL. Streamlang doesn't always have 1:1 parity with the ingest processors because it needs to support options that work in both ingest pipelines and ES|QL. In most cases, you won't need to worry about these details, but the underlying design decisions still affect the UI and available configuration options. The following are some limitations and inconsistencies when using Streamlang processors:

- **Consistently typed fields**: ES|QL requires one consistent type per column, so workflows that produce mixed types across documents won't transpile.
- **Conversion of types**: ES|QL and ingest pipelines accept different conversion combinations and strictness (especially for strings), so `convert` can behave differently across targets.
- **Multi-value commands/functions**: Fields can contain one or multiple values. ES|QL and ingest processors don't always handle these cases the same way. For example, grok in ES|QL handles multiple values automatically, while the grok processor does not
- **Conditional execution**: ES|QL's enforced table shape limits conditional casting, parsing, and wildcard field operations that ingest pipelines can do per-document.
- **Arrays of objects / flattening**: Ingest pipelines preserve nested JSON arrays, while ES|QL flattens to columns, so operations like rename and delete on parent objects can differ or fail.

## Add processors [streams-add-processors]

Streams uses [{{es}} ingest pipelines](../../../../manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md) made up of processors to transform your data, without requiring you to switch interfaces and manually update pipelines.

To add a processor from the **Processing** tab:

1. Select **Create** → **Create processor** to open a list of supported processors.
1. Select a processor from the **Processor** menu.
1. Configure the processor and select **Create** to save the processor.

After adding all desired processors and conditions, select **Save changes**.

Refer to individual [supported processors](#streams-extract-processors) for more on configuring specific processors.

:::{note}
Editing processors with JSON is planned for a future release, and additional processors may be supported over time.

### Generate pipeline suggestions [streams-generate-pipeline-suggestions]
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.3+
serverless: preview
```
:::{note}
This feature requires a [Generative AI connector](kibana://reference/connectors-kibana/gen-ai-connectors.md).
:::

Setting up processors is generally a multistep process. For example, you might need a grok processor to extract fields, a date processor to convert timestamps, and a remove processor to get rid of temporary fields. Instead of creating individual processors manually, you can have AI suggest an entire pipeline for you:

1. From the **Processing** tab, select **Suggest a pipeline**.
1. Review the suggested processors, and either **Accept** or **Reject** the suggestions.
1. Select **Regenerate** to have Streams regenerate the suggested pipeline. Change the LLM that Streams uses to generate suggestions from the {icon}`controls` menu.

#### How does **Suggest a pipeline** work? [streams-pipeline-generation]

:::{include} ../../../_snippets/streams-suggestions.md
:::

### Add conditions [streams-add-processor-conditions]

You can add conditions, Boolean expressions that are evaluated for each document, and attach processors that only run when those conditions are met.

To add a condition:

1. Select **Create** → **Create condition**.
1. Provide a **Field**, a **Value**, and a comparator.
1. Select **Create condition**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

:::{dropdown} Supported comparators
Streams processors support the following comparators:

- equals
- not equals
- less than
- less than or equals
- greater than
- greater than or equals
- contains
- starts with
- ends with
- exists
- not exists
:::

After creating a condition, add a processor or another condition to it by selecting the {icon}`plus_in_circle`.

### Editing modes [streams-editing-modes]

The Streams processing UI provides an [interactive mode](#streams-editing-interactive-mode) and a [YAML mode](#streams-editing-yaml-mode) for editing processors and conditions.

To switch modes, select the appropriate tab from the top of the processing page.

:::{image} ../../../images/streams-editing-modes.png
:screenshot:
:::

Streams defaults to interactive mode unless the configuration can't be represented in interactive mode (for example, when nesting levels are too deep).

#### Interactive mode [streams-editing-interactive-mode]

**Interactive** mode provides a form-based interface for creating and editing processors. This mode works best for:

- Users who prefer a guided, visual approach
- Configurations that don't require deeply nested conditions

#### YAML mode [streams-editing-yaml-mode]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.3+
```

**YAML** mode provides a code editor for writing Streamlang directly. This mode works best for:

- Users who prefer working with code
- Advanced configurations with complex or deeply nested conditions

Refer to the [Streamlang reference](./streamlang.md) for the complete syntax, condition operators, and examples.


### Preview changes [streams-preview-changes]

After you create processors, the **Data preview** tab simulates processor results with additional filtering options depending on the outcome of the simulation.

When you add or edit processors, the **Data preview** tab updates automatically.

:::{note}
To avoid unexpected results, it's best to add processors rather than remove or reorder existing ones.
:::

The **Data preview** tab loads 100 documents from your existing data and runs your changes against them.
For any newly created processors and conditions, the preview results are reliable, and you can freely create and reorder during the preview.

After making sure everything in the **Data preview** tab is correct, select **Save changes** to apply your changes to the data stream.

If you edit the stream after saving your changes, keep the following in mind:

- Adding processors to the end of the list works as expected.
- Editing or reordering existing processors can cause inaccurate results. Because the pipeline might have already processed the documents used for sampling, **Data preview** cannot accurately simulate changes to existing data.
- Adding a new processor and moving it before an existing processor can cause inaccurate results. **Data preview** only simulates the new processor, not the existing ones, so the simulation may not accurately reflect changes to existing data.

### Ignore failures [streams-ignore-failures]

Each processor has the **Ignore failures** option. When enabled, document processing continues when even if the processor fails.

### Ignore missing fields [streams-ignore-missing-fields]

Dissect, grok, and rename processors include the **Ignore missing fields** option. When enabled, document processing continues even if a source field is missing.

### Processor actions [streams-processor-actions]

To modify an existing processor, open the actions menu {icon}`boxes_vertical` next to it to see the available options:

* **Move up** or **Move down**: Change the order of the processor.
* **Add description**: Change the processor description from its metadata to a description of your choice.
* **Remove description**: For processors with an added description, use this option to return the description to the metadata.
* **Edit**: Modify the processor configuration.
* **Duplicate**: Create another processor with the same configuration to use as a template.
* **Delete**: Remove the processor permanently.

## Detect and resolve failures [streams-detect-failures]

Documents can fail processing for various reasons. Streams helps you identify and resolve these issues before deploying changes.

In the following screenshot, the **Failed** percentage indicates that some messages didn't match the provided grok pattern:

:::{image} ../../../images/logs-streams-parsed.png
:screenshot:
:::

You can filter your documents by selecting **Parsed** or **Failed** on the **Data preview** tab.
Selecting **Failed** shows the documents that weren't parsed correctly:

:::{image} ../../../images/logs-streams-failures.png
:screenshot:
:::

Streams displays failures at the bottom of the process editor. Some failures might require fixes, while others serve as a warning:

:::{image} ../../../images/logs-streams-processor-failures.png
:screenshot:
:::

### Mapping conflicts [streams-processing-mapping-conflicts]

As part of processing, Streams simulates your changes end to end to check for mapping conflicts. If it detects a conflict, Streams marks the processor as failed and displays a message like the following:

:::{image} ../../../images/logs-streams-mapping-conflicts.png
:screenshot:
:::

Use the information in the failure message to find and troubleshoot the mapping issues.

## Processor statistics and detected fields [streams-stats-and-detected-fields]

Once saved, the processor displays its success rate and the fields it added.

:::{image} ../../../images/logs-streams-field-stats.png
:screenshot:
:::

## Advanced: How and where do these changes get applied to the underlying data stream? [streams-applied-changes]

When you save processors, Streams appends processing to the best-matching ingest pipeline for the data stream. It either chooses the best-matching pipeline ending in `@custom` in your data stream, or it adds one for you.

Streams identifies the appropriate `@custom` pipeline (for example, `logs-myintegration@custom` or `logs@custom`) by checking the `default_pipeline` that is set on the data stream. You can view the default pipeline on the **Advanced** tab under **Ingest pipeline**.

In this default pipeline, Streams locates the last processor that calls a pipeline ending in `@custom`.
- For integrations, this would result in a pipeline name like `logs-myintegration@custom`.
- Without an integration, the only `@custom` pipeline available may be `logs@custom`.

If no default pipeline is detected, Streams adds a default pipeline to the data stream by updating the index templates.

If a default pipeline is detected, but it does not contain a custom pipeline, Streams adds the pipeline processor directly to the pipeline.

Streams then adds a pipeline processor to the end of that `@custom` pipeline. This processor definition directs matching documents to a dedicated pipeline managed by Streams called `<data_stream_name>@stream.processing`:

```json
// Example processor added to the relevant @custom pipeline
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "<data_stream_name>@stream.processing", // for example, logs-my-app-default@stream.processing
    "if": "ctx._index == '<data_stream_name>'",
    "ignore_missing_pipeline": true,
    "description": "Call the stream's managed pipeline - do not change this manually but instead use the Streams UI or API"
  }
}
```

Streams then creates and manages the `<data_stream_name>@stream.processing` pipeline, adding the [processors](#streams-add-processors) you configured in the UI.

### User interaction with pipelines

Do not manually modify the `<data_stream_name>@stream.processing` pipeline created by Streams.
You can still add your own processors manually to the `@custom` pipeline if needed. Adding processors before the pipeline processor created by Streams might cause unexpected behavior.

## Known limitations [streams-known-limitations]

- Streams does not support all processors. More processors will be added in future versions.
- The data preview simulation might not accurately reflect the changes to the existing data when editing existing processors or re-ordering them. Streams will allow proper simulations using original documents in a future version.
- Streams can't properly handle arrays. While it supports basic actions like appending or renaming, it can't access individual array elements. For classic streams, the workaround is to use the [manual pipeline configuration](./extract/manual-pipeline-configuration.md) that supports Painless scripting and all ingest processors.
