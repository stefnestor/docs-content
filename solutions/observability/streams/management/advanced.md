# Configure advanced settings for streams [streams-advanced-settings]

The **Advanced** tab on the **Manage stream** page shows the underlying configuration details of your stream. While Streams simplifies many configurations, it doesn't support modifying all pipelines and templates. From the **Advanced** tab, you can manually interact with the index or component templates or modify other ingest pipelines that used by the stream.

This UI is intended for advanced users.
