# Wired streams [streams-wired-streams]

Wired streams send your documents to a wired streams endpoint, from which you can route data into child streams based on [partitioning](./management/partitioning.md) rules you set up manually or with the help of AI suggestions.

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { serverless: preview, stack: preview 9.4+ }

Wired streams use the following endpoints:

- **`logs.otel`**: Normalizes data to OpenTelemetry format (field mapping shown in [field naming table](#streams-wired-streams-field-naming))
- **`logs.ecs`**: Preserves original ECS field names without transformation

::::

::::{applies-item} stack: preview 9.2-9.3

Send logs to the `/logs` endpoint, which normalizes data to OpenTelemetry format.

::::

:::::

:::{warning}
:applies_to: {"stack": "9.4+", "serverless": "ga"}
The `/logs` endpoint is deprecated and replaced by the `logs.otel` and `logs.ecs` endpoints.

## Wired streams field naming [streams-wired-streams-field-naming]

::::{applies-switch}

:::{applies-item} { serverless: preview, stack: preview 9.4+ }

Field naming depends on the endpoint you use.

### `logs.ecs` endpoint

Data ingested into the `logs.ecs` endpoint is stored in the original ECS field names without being transformed. The fields remain as shown in the "ECS field" column in the [field naming table](#streams-wired-streams-field-name-table).

### `logs.otel` endpoint

Data ingested into the `logs.otel` endpoint is stored and processed in a normalized OpenTelemetry (OTel)–compatible format. This format aligns ECS fields with OTel semantic conventions so all data is consistently structured and OTTL-expressible.

When data is ingested into a wired stream, it’s automatically translated into this normalized format:
- Standard ECS documents are converted to OTel fields (`message → body.text`, `log.level → severity_text`, `host.name → resource.attributes.host.name`, and so on).
- Custom fields are stored under `attributes.*`.

To preserve backward-compatible querying, Streams creates aliases that mirror existing `logs-*.otel-*` data streams behavior. This allows queries to use either ECS or OTel field names interchangeably.

Refer to the following table for ECS fields and corresponding OTel fields.

## Manage wired streams [streams-wired-streams-enable]

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { serverless: preview, stack: preview 9.4+ }

Wired streams are on by default. To disable wired streams:

1. Go to the **Streams** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md), then open **Settings**.
1. Turn off **Enable wired streams**.

To re-enable, repeat these steps and turn on **Enable wired streams**.

::::

::::{applies-item} stack: preview 9.2-9.3

To turn on wired streams:

1. Go to the **Streams** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md), then open **Settings**.
1. Turn on **Enable wired streams**.

## Ship data to streams [streams-wired-streams-ship]

{applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4+` You can send data to wired streams using the {{observability}} quickstart flows. When adding data from the **Add Data** page, select **Wired Streams** as the ingestion mode and the generated commands will include all necessary routing configuration. For more information, refer to [Get started with Elastic {{observability}}](/solutions/observability/get-started.md).

To manually configure your shippers to send data to the appropriate wired streams endpoint, complete the following configurations for your shipper:

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} OpenTelemetry
:::{note}
Set the index in the following configuration based on your {{stack}} version:

- {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.2-9.3` Set the index to `logs`. Only the `logs` endpoint is available in these versions.
- {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4+` Set the index to `logs.otel` or `logs.ecs`, depending on which endpoint you want to use.
:::

```yaml
processors:
  transform/logs-streams:
    log_statements:
      - context: resource
        statements:
          - set(attributes["elasticsearch.index"], "logs.otel") # Set to `logs.otel` or `logs.ecs` (serverless and stack 9.4+), or `logs` (stack 9.2–9.3)
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [myreceiver] # works with any logs receiver
      processors: [transform/logs-streams]
      exporters: [elasticsearch, otlp] # works with either
```

    action => "create"
  }
}
```
::::

::::{tab-item} Fleet
Use the **Custom Logs (Filestream)** integration to send data to wired streams:

1. Find **Fleet** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
1. Under **Outputs**, find the output you want to use to send data to streams, and select the {icon}`pencil` icon.
1. Turn on **Write to logs streams**.
1. Add the **Custom Logs (Filestream)** integration to an agent policy.
1. Enable the **Use the "logs" data stream** setting in the integration configuration under **Change defaults**.
1. Under **Where to add this integration**, select an agent policy that uses the output you configured in step 4.
::::

::::{tab-item} API
:::{note}
Set the endpoint in the following configuration based on your {{stack}} version:

- {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.2-9.3` Set the endpoint to `logs`. Only the `logs` endpoint is available in these versions.
- {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4+` Set the endpoint to `logs.otel` or `logs.ecs`, depending on which endpoint you want to use.

Send data to the endpoint using the [Bulk API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-bulk). Refer to the following example for more information:

```json
POST /logs.otel/_bulk # Set to `logs.otel` or `logs.ecs` (serverless or stack 9.4+), or `logs` (stack 9.2–9.3)
{ "create": {} }

## View wired streams in Discover [streams-wired-streams-discover]

To view wired log streams in Discover:

1. Manually [create a data view](../../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/data-views.md#settings-create-pattern) for the wired streams index pattern (`logs,logs.*`).
1. add the wireds streams index pattern (`logs,logs.*`) to the `observability:logSources` {{kib}} advanced setting, which you can open from the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](../../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

## Next steps

After sending your data to wired streams:

- [Partition data](./management/partitioning.md): Use the **Partitioning** tab to send data into meaningful child streams.
- [Extract fields](./management/extract.md): Use the **Processing** tab to filter and analyze your data effectively.
- [Map fields](./management/schema.md): Use the **Schema** tab to make fields easier to query.
