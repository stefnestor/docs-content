# Elasticsearch solution overview

The {{es}} solution and serverless project type enable you to build your own applications on top of the {{es}} platform's scalable data store, search engine, and vector database capabilities.

{{es}} is a distributed datastore that can ingest, index, and manage various types of data in near real-time, making them both searchable and analyzable.
With specialized user interfaces and tools, it provides the flexibility to create, deploy, and run a wide range of applications, from search to analytics to AI-driven solutions.

## Use cases

Here are a few common real-world applications:

| Use case                             | Business goals                                                     | Technical requirements                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vector search/hybrid search** | Run nearest neighbour search, combine with text for hybrid results | Dense embeddings, sparse embeddings, combined with text/BM25       |
| **Ecommerce/product catalog search** | Provide fast, relevant, and up-to-date results, faceted navigation | Inventory sync, user behavior tracking, results caching       |
| **Workplace/knowledge base search**  | Search across range of data sources, enforcing permissions         | Third-party connectors, document-level security, role mapping |
| **Website search**                   | Deliver relevant, up-to-date results                               | Web crawling, incremental indexing, query caching             |
| **Customer support search**          | Surface relevant solutions, manage access controls, track metrics  | Knowledge graph, role-based access, analytics                 |
| **Chatbots/RAG**                     | Enable natural conversations, provide context, maintain knowledge  | Vector search, ML models, knowledge base integration          |
| **Geospatial search**                | Process location queries, sort by proximity, filter by area        | Geo-mapping, spatial indexing, distance calculations          |
