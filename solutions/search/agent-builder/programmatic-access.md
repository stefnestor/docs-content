# Work programmatically with {{agent-builder}}

{{agent-builder}} provides comprehensive APIs and additional integration options for programmatic access and automation.

These interfaces enable you to build integrations with other applications and extend Agent Builder's capabilities to fit your specific requirements.

- **[Kibana API](kibana-api.md)**: RESTful APIs for working with {{agent-builder}} programmatically
- **[MCP server](mcp-server.md)**: A standardized interface that allows external MCP clients (such as Claude Desktop or Cursor) to access {{agent-builder}} tools
- **[A2A server](a2a-server.md)**: Agent-to-agent communication endpoints that follow the A2A protocol specification, enabling external A2A clients to interact with {{agent-builder}} agents
