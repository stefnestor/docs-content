# Query rules UI
Use query rules to pin or exclude specific documents when queries contain specific keywords or phrases, or match specific search patterns.
The Query rules UI provides a graphical interface to manage these rules without writing API calls or JSON configuration.

The UI enables you to:

- Set keyword or numerical conditions. For a full list of options, refer to [Rule criteria](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules.md#query-rule-criteria).
- Pin or exclude specific documents in results
- Organize rules into rulesets and set execution priority
- Test rules against sample queries before publishing

## UI vs. API: What's the difference?

The Query Rules UI provides the same functionality as the API with one key difference:

* The UI defaults to `docs` for creating and editing rules. You cannot edit an `id` based rule that was created through the API.

For examples of how to search using query rules, refer to [Search using Query Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules).

If you prefer to use the Query Rules API, refer to [Query Rules API]({{es-apis}}group/endpoint-query_rules).

## Requirements

For full access to the Query Rules UI, you need the following privileges:

* Appropriate roles to access Kibana. For more information, refer to [Built-in roles](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md) or  [Kibana privileges](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges)
* A role with `manage_search_query_rules` cluster privilege
* `ALL` option for `Query Rules` role privilege in the respective Kibana space

## Accessing the Query Rules UI

Go to the **Query Rules** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md). If the option does not appear, contact your administrator to review your privileges.

	- **Exclude**: Exclude selected documents from the results.
   
   For more information on rule types, refer to [Rule types](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules#query-rule-type).
4. Select one or more documents for the rule to apply to.
5. Select one of the following rule criteria:
    - **Always**: Apply the rule to all queries
    - **Custom**: Define conditions when the rule is applied.

   For a full list of options, refer to [Rule criteria](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules.md#query-rule-criteria).
6. Select **Create rule**.
