After you create a case, you can upload and manage files on the **Files** tab. To find the tab:

- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3`: Go to the case's details page, then select the **Attachments** tab.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0`: Go to the case's details page.

To download or delete the file or copy the file hash to your clipboard, open the action menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal`. The available hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

When you upload a file, a comment is added to the case activity log. To view an image, click its name in the activity or file list.
