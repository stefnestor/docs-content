# Manually run Attack Discovery from the Attacks view [manual-runs-from-attacks-page]

Manually run Attack Discovery when you want to analyze the current alert selection right away, for example after you change settings or during an active investigation. Discoveries from a manual run appear in the **Attacks** table alongside scheduled discoveries.

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { "stack": "ga 9.5+", "serverless": {"security": "ga"} }

To manually run Attack Discovery from the **Attacks** view:

1. Go to **Detections** → **Views** → **Attacks**.
2. [Configure Attack Discovery settings](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/configure-alert-retrieval-from-attacks-page.md) in **Settings** next to **Run**, and confirm an LLM connector is selected. You can start analysis from the flyout with **Save and run**, or close the flyout and continue with the next step.
3. Select **Run**. A notification confirms that generation has started.

Analysis can take from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the number of alerts and the model. Open **Generations** in the **Attacks** view header to watch progress. When the run finishes, refresh the **Attacks** view to see new discoveries in the same table as scheduled discoveries (labeled as manually generated). Select **Run** again anytime to start another analysis with the current alert selection.

:::{note}
Attack Discovery uses the same data anonymization settings as [Elastic AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md). Configure which alert fields are sent to the LLM, and which are obfuscated, in the Elastic AI Assistant settings. Consider the privacy policies of third-party LLMs before sending them sensitive data.
:::

After the run finishes, [manage discoveries from the Attacks view](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/manage-discoveries-from-attacks-page.md). If the run fails, [troubleshoot it with AI](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/troubleshoot-runs-from-attacks-page.md). To run Attack Discovery automatically at intervals, [schedule a run](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/schedule-runs-from-attacks-page.md).

Start manual runs from the [Attack Discovery page](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/run-from-attack-discovery-page.md#attack-discovery-generate-discoveries). Use the **Attacks** page for triage, or [schedule a run](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/schedule-runs-from-attacks-page.md) for recurring analysis.
