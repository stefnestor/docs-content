# Grant access to Attack Discovery [attack-discovery-rbac]

Attack Discovery requires specific {{kib}} feature privileges and, in most versions, index privileges on Attack Discovery alert indices. Some capabilities also require Workflows privileges.

After you grant the right access, [choose how to run Attack Discovery](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/run-attack-discovery.md).

## {{kib}} feature privileges [ad-kibana-privileges]

Your role needs these [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-role-management.md#adding_kibana_privileges) for the **Security** features in your version:

| Available in | Privileges |
|---|---|
| {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` | `All` for **Attack discovery**, and at least `Read` for **Rules and Exceptions** and **Alerts** |
| {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1-9.3` | `All` for **Security > Attack discovery**, and at least `Read` for **Security > Rules, Alerts, and Exceptions** |
| {applies_to}`stack: ga =9.0` | `All` for **Security > Attack discovery** |


### Schedules sub-feature privilege [ad-schedules-privilege]

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.1+
serverless:
  security: ga
```

**Attack discovery** includes a **Schedules** sub-feature privilege:

| UI label | What it controls |
|---|---|
| **Schedules → Allow changes** | Create, edit, enable, disable, or delete Attack discovery schedules |

Selecting `All` for **Attack discovery** includes **Allow changes**. To run Attack Discovery without managing schedules, turn on **Customize sub-feature privileges** and clear **Allow changes**.

## Index privileges [ad-index-privileges]

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.1+
serverless:
  security: ga
```

Your role needs the appropriate [index privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-role-management.md#adding_index_privileges) based on what it must do with Attack Discovery alerts. Replace `<space-id>` with the {{kib}} space ID.

### Read Attack Discovery alerts

Your role needs the {{es}} privileges `read` and `view_index_metadata` on these indices:

* `.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.adhoc.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.adhoc.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`

### Read and modify Attack Discovery alerts

Your role needs the {{es}} privileges `read`, `view_index_metadata`, `write`, and `maintenance` on these indices to generate discoveries manually or with schedules, share manually created alerts with other users, and update a discovery's status:

* `.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.adhoc.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.adhoc.alerts-security.attack.discovery.alerts-<space-id>`

## Grant Workflows privileges for Attack Discovery [attack-discovery-workflows-privileges]

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.5+
serverless:
  security: ga
```

When you turn on [Attack Discovery Workflows](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#enable-attack-discovery-workflows), your role also needs **Analytics > Workflows** privileges. {{serverless-short}} roles include that access by default. On self-managed and {{ech}} deployments, add it to custom roles.

| Attack Discovery action | Workflows privilege needed |
|---|---|
| Monitor runs in **Generations** and open workflow execution details | `read` for **Analytics → Workflows** |
| Generate discoveries (manual or scheduled) | `read` and `execute` for **Analytics → Workflows** |
| Create, edit, or enable schedules | `read` and `execute` for **Analytics → Workflows**, plus [**Schedules** → **Allow changes**](#ad-schedules-privilege) |
| Deactivate or delete schedules | [**Schedules** → **Allow changes**](#ad-schedules-privilege) only |

Granting `All` for **Analytics → Workflows** includes `read` and `execute`. For finer-grained access, use Workflows [sub-feature privileges](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/setup.md#workflows-role-access).
