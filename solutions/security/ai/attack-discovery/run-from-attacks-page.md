# Run Attack Discovery from the Attacks view [run-from-attacks-page]

From the **Attacks** view, configure which alerts to analyze, then start a manual or scheduled run. Discoveries appear in the same view next to their related alerts.

## Before you begin [run-from-attacks-page-before-you-begin]

To use the **Attacks** view, you need:

* The [Enable alerts and attacks alignment](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#enable-alerts-and-attacks-alignment) advanced setting turned on (only required for {{stack}} 9.4). 
* The [Attack Discovery Workflows](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#enable-attack-discovery-workflows) advanced setting turned on if you want the settings flyout with skill, query, and workflow retrieval.
* A [configured LLM connector](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/llm-connectors.md) that uses a model recommended for Attack Discovery in the [Large language model performance matrix](/solutions/security/ai/large-language-model-performance-matrix.md), unless your subscription or project already includes an [Elastic Managed LLM](kibana://reference/connectors-kibana/elastic-managed-llm.md).
* A role with the [index privileges](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/grant-access.md#ad-index-privileges) required to generate and read discoveries, and these [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-role-management.md#adding_kibana_privileges) at minimum:
  * **Security → Attack discovery**: `All`
  * **Security → Rules and Exceptions**: `Read`
  * **Security → Alerts**: `Read`
