# {{elastic-defend}} requirements [elastic-endpoint-deploy-reqs]

To properly deploy {{elastic-defend}} on macOS without a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile, you must manually enable additional permissions on the host before {{elastic-endpoint}}—the installed component that performs {{elastic-defend}}'s threat monitoring and prevention—is fully functional.
