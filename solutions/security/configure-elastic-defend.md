# Configure endpoint protection with {{elastic-defend}} [endpoint-protection-intro]

{{elastic-defend}} is Elastic's endpoint protection integration. It prevents and detects malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts. When a threat is detected, {{elastic-defend}} can generate an alert or block the activity outright, depending on your protection settings.

{{elastic-defend}} runs as part of [{{agent}}](/reference/fleet/index.md), which you deploy to each host you want to protect. Once installed, {{agent}} communicates with {{fleet}} for centralized policy management and sends security data to {{elastic-sec}}, where you can investigate alerts, manage exceptions, and respond to threats.

## How {{elastic-defend}}, {{agent}}, and {{elastic-endpoint}} work together

{{elastic-defend}} relies on three components that each play a distinct role in endpoint protection:

- **{{elastic-defend}}** is the integration that defines your protection policy — which threat protections are active, which events to collect, and which exceptions to apply. You add it to an {{agent}} policy and configure it through the {{elastic-sec}} UI or API.
- **{{agent}}** is the unified agent you install on each host. It manages integrations (including {{elastic-defend}}), handles enrollment and communication with {{fleet}}, and ships collected data to {{es}}.
- **{{elastic-endpoint}}** is the component that {{agent}} installs on the host when the {{elastic-defend}} integration is added. It performs the actual threat monitoring, prevention, and response actions at the operating system level.


In practice, you add the {{elastic-defend}} integration from the **Integrations** page, assign it to an {{agent}} policy, and deploy {{agent}} to your hosts. {{agent}} installs {{elastic-endpoint}}, which immediately begins monitoring the host according to your policy settings.

## Where to start

| Your goal | Start here |
|---|---|
| Deploy {{elastic-defend}} for the first time | [Requirements](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/elastic-defend-requirements.md) → [Install {{elastic-defend}}](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/install-elastic-defend.md) |
| Configure protection and event collection settings | [Configure an integration policy](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/configure-an-integration-policy-for-elastic-defend.md) |
| Control which users can access {{elastic-defend}} features | [Feature privileges](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/elastic-defend-feature-privileges.md) |
| Set up endpoints in restricted networks | [Configure offline endpoints and air-gapped environments](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/configure-offline-endpoints-air-gapped-environments.md) |
| Send endpoint data to a remote {{es}} output | [Use {{elastic-defend}} with a remote {{es}} output](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/use-elastic-defend-with-remote-output-and-ccs.md) |
| Remove {{agent}} from a host | [Uninstall {{agent}}](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/uninstall-elastic-agent.md) |

## Next steps

After installing and configuring {{elastic-defend}}, you can:

- [Manage endpoints, policies, and exceptions](/solutions/security/manage-elastic-defend.md) to tune protection for your environment.
- Read [Optimize {{elastic-defend}}](/solutions/security/manage-elastic-defend/optimize-elastic-defend.md) to understand different {{elastic-endpoint}} configuration settings.
- [Set up endpoint response actions](/solutions/security/endpoint-response-actions.md) to isolate hosts, run commands, or take other actions on protected endpoints.
- [Troubleshoot {{elastic-defend}}](/troubleshoot/security/elastic-defend.md) if you run into installation, connectivity, or policy issues.
