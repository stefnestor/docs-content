# Set up Cloud Asset Discovery for AWS

## Overview [cad-aws-overview]

This page explains how to set up the Cloud Asset Discovery integration to inventory assets in AWS.

## Requirements
* The user who gives the Cloud Asset Discovery integration AWS permissions must be an AWS account `admin`.
* The Cloud Asset Discovery integration is available to all {{ecloud}} users. On-premise deployments require [appropriate subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) level.
* The Cloud Asset Discovery integration supports only the AWS commercial cloud platform. AWS GovCloud is not supported. To request support, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose).




## Set up Cloud Asset Discovery for AWS [cad-aws-setup]

You can set up Cloud Asset Discovery for AWS either by enrolling a single cloud account, or by enrolling an organization containing multiple accounts. Either way, first you will add the integration, then enable cloud account access. 

Two deployment technologies are available: agentless and agent-based. 

* [Agentless deployment](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-agentless) allows you to collect cloud posture data without having to manage the deployment of an agent in your cloud. 
* [Agent-based deployment](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-agent-based) requires you to deploy and manage an agent in the cloud account you want to monitor.

## Agentless deployment [cad-aws-agentless]

1. Find **Integrations** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Search for and select `Cloud asset discovery`.
3. Click **Add Cloud Asset Discovery**.
4. Select **AWS**, then either **AWS Organization** to onboard multiple accounts, or **Single Account** to onboard an individual account.
5. Give your integration a name that matches the purpose or team of the AWS account/organization you want to monitor, for example, `dev-aws-account`.
6. In **Deployment options**, select **Agentless**.
7. Next, you’ll need to authenticate to AWS. The following methods are available:

    * Option 1: Cloud connector (recommended). {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.2` {applies_to}`serverless: preview` 
      * To use a pre-existing cloud connector for this deployment, select it under **Existing connection**. 
      * To use a new cloud connector: under **New connection**, expand the **Steps to assume role** section. Complete the instructions to generate a `Role ARN` and `External ID`; enter them in {{kib}}.

      ::::{important}
      In order to use cloud connector for an AWS integration, your {{kib}} instance must be hosted on AWS. In other words, you must have chosen AWS hosting during {{kib}} setup.
      ::::

    * Option 2: Direct access keys/CloudFormation. For **Preferred method**, select **Direct access keys**. Expand the **Steps to Generate AWS Account Credentials** section, then follow the displayed instructions to automatically create the necessary credentials using CloudFormation.

       ::::{note}
       If you don’t want to monitor every account in your organization, specify which to monitor using the `OrganizationalUnitIDs` field that appears after you click **Launch CloudFormation**.
       ::::

    * Option 3: Temporary keys. To authenticate using temporary keys, refer to the instructions for [temporary keys](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-temp-credentials).

8. Once you’ve selected an authentication method and provided all necessary credentials, click **Save and continue** to finish deployment. Your data should start to appear within a few minutes.

## Agent-based deployment [cad-aws-agent-based]


### Add the Cloud Asset Discovery integration [cad-aws-add-and-name-integration]

1. Find **Integrations** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Search for and select `Cloud asset discovery`.
3. Click **Add Cloud Asset Discovery**.
4. Select **AWS**, then either **AWS Organization** to onboard multiple accounts, or **Single Account** to onboard an individual account.
5. Give your integration a name that matches the purpose or team of the AWS account/organization you want to monitor, for example, `dev-aws-account`.


### Set up cloud account access [cad-aws-set-up-cloud-access-section]

Cloud Asset Discovery requires access to AWS’s built-in [`SecurityAudit` IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_security-auditor) in order to discover resources in your cloud account. There are several ways to provide access.

For most use cases, the simplest option is to use AWS CloudFormation to automatically provision the necessary resources and permissions in your AWS account. This method, as well as several manual options, are described next on this page.


### CloudFormation (recommended) [cad-aws-set-up-cloudformation]

1. From the **Add Cloud Asset Discovery integration** menu, in **Setup Access**, select **CloudFormation**.
2. In a new browser tab or window, log in as an admin to the AWS account or organization you want to onboard.
3. Return to your {{kib}} tab. Click **Save and continue** at the bottom of the page.
4. Review the information, then click **Launch CloudFormation**.
5. A CloudFormation template appears in a new browser tab.
6. For organization-level deployments only, you must enter the ID of the organizational units where you want to deploy into the CloudFormation template’s `OrganizationalUnitIds` field. You can find organizational unit IDs in the AWS console under **AWS Organizations → AWS Accounts** (under each organization’s name). You can also use this field to specify which accounts in your organization to monitor, and which to skip.
7. (Optional) Switch to the AWS region where you want to deploy using the controls in the upper right corner.
8. Tick the checkbox in **Capabilities** to authorize the creation of necessary resources.
9. At the bottom of the template, select **Create stack**.

When you return to {{kib}}, click **View assets** to review the data being collected by your new integration.


### Manual authentication for organization-level onboarding [cad-aws-setup-organization-manual]

::::{note}
If you’re onboarding a single account instead of an organization, skip this section.
::::


When using manual authentication to onboard at the organization level, you need to configure the necessary permissions using the AWS console for the organization where you want to deploy:

* In the organization’s management account (root account), create an IAM role called `cloudbeat-asset-inventory-root` (the name is important). The role needs several policies:

    * The following inline policy:


::::{dropdown} Click to expand policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "organizations:List*",
                "organizations:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

::::


   * The following trust policy:

::::{dropdown} Click to expand policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Management Account ID>:root" <1>
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

1. Replace `<Management account ID>` in the trust policy with your AWS account ID.

::::

* The AWS-managed `SecurityAudit` policy.

* Next, for each account you want to scan in the organization, create an IAM role named `cloudbeat-asset-inventory-securityaudit` with the following policies:

    * The AWS-managed `SecurityAudit` policy.
    * The following trust policy:


::::{dropdown} Click to expand policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Management Account ID>:role/cloudbeat-asset-inventory-root" <1>
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```


1. Replace `<Management account ID>` in this trust policy with your AWS account ID.
::::

After creating the necessary roles, authenticate using one of the manual authentication methods.

::::{important}
When deploying to an organization using any of the authentication methods on this page, you need to make sure that the credentials you provide grant permission to assume `cloudbeat-asset-inventory-root` privileges.
::::



### Manual authentication methods [cad-aws-set-up-manual]

* [Default instance role (recommended)](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-use-instance-role)
* [Direct access keys](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-use-keys-directly)
* [Temporary security credentials](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-temp-credentials)
* [Shared credentials file](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-use-a-shared-credentials-file)
* [IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-use-iam-arn)

::::{important}
Whichever method you use to authenticate, make sure AWS’s built-in [`SecurityAudit` IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_security-auditor) is attached.
::::



#### Option 1 - Default instance role [cad-aws-use-instance-role]

::::{note}
If you are deploying to an AWS organization instead of an AWS account, you should already have [created a new role](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-setup-organization-manual), `cloudbeat-asset-inventory-root`. Skip to step 2 "Attach your new IAM role to an EC2 instance", and attach this role. You can use either an existing or new EC2 instance.
::::


Follow AWS’s [IAM roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) documentation to create an IAM role using the IAM console, which automatically generates an instance profile.

1. Create an IAM role:

    1. In AWS, go to your IAM dashboard. Click **Roles**, then **Create role**.
    2. On the **Select trusted entity** page, in **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS service**.
    3. In **Use case**, select **EC2**. Click **Next**.
    4. On the **Add permissions** page, search for and select `SecurityAudit`. Click **Next**.
    5. On the **Name, review, and create** page, name your role, then click **Create role**.

2. Attach your new IAM role to an EC2 instance:

    1. In AWS, select an EC2 instance.
    2. Select **Actions > Security > Modify IAM role**.
    3. On the **Modify IAM role** page, search for and select your new IAM role.
    4. Click **Update IAM role**.
    5. Return to {{kib}} and [finish manual setup](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-finish-manual).


::::{important}
Make sure to deploy Cloud Asset Discovery to this EC2 instance. When completing setup in {{kib}}, in the **Setup Access** section, select **Assume role**. Leave **Role ARN** empty for agentless deployments. For agent-based deployments, leave it empty unless you want to specify a role the {{agent}} should assume instead of the default role for your EC2 instance. Click **Save and continue**.
::::



#### Option 2 - Direct access keys [cad-aws-use-keys-directly]

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or AWS account root user. To use access keys as credentials, you must provide the `Access key ID` and the `Secret Access Key`. After you provide credentials, [finish manual setup](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-finish-manual).

For more details, refer to [Access Keys and Secret Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html).

::::{important}
You must select **Programmatic access** when creating the IAM user.
::::



#### Option 3 - Temporary security credentials [cad-aws-temp-credentials]

You can configure temporary security credentials in AWS to last for a specified duration. They consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token, which is typically found using `GetSessionToken`.

Because temporary security credentials are short term, once they expire, you will need to generate new ones and manually update the integration’s configuration to continue collecting cloud posture data. Update the credentials before they expire to avoid data loss.

::::{note}
IAM users with multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled need to submit an MFA code when calling `GetSessionToken`. For more details, refer to AWS’s [Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) documentation.
::::


You can use the AWS CLI to generate temporary credentials. For example, you could use the following command if you have MFA enabled:

```console
sts get-session-token --serial-number arn:aws:iam::1234:mfa/your-email@example.com --duration-seconds 129600 --token-code 123456
```

The output from this command includes the following fields, which you should provide when configuring the integration:

* `Access key ID`: The first part of the access key.
* `Secret Access Key`: The second part of the access key.
* `Session Token`: The required token when using temporary security credentials.

After you provide credentials, [finish manual setup](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-finish-manual).


#### Option 4 - Shared credentials file [cad-aws-use-a-shared-credentials-file]

If you use different AWS credentials for different tools or applications, you can use profiles to define multiple access keys in the same configuration file. For more details, refer to AWS' [Shared Credentials Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) documentation.

Instead of providing the `Access key ID` and `Secret Access Key` to the integration, provide the information required to locate the access keys within the shared credentials file:

* `Credential Profile Name`: The profile name in the shared credentials file.
* `Shared Credential File`: The directory of the shared credentials file.

If you don’t provide values for all configuration fields, the integration will use these defaults:

* If `Access key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, and `ARN Role` are not provided, then the integration will check for `Credential Profile Name`.
* If there is no `Credential Profile Name`, the default profile will be used.
* If `Shared Credential File` is empty, the default directory will be used.
* For Linux or Unix, the shared credentials file is located at `~/.aws/credentials`.

After providing credentials, [finish manual setup](/solutions/security/cloud/asset-disc-aws.md#cad-aws-finish-manual).


#### Option 5 - IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) [cad-aws-use-iam-arn]

An IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is an IAM identity that you can create in your AWS account. You define the role’s permissions. Roles do not have standard long-term credentials such as passwords or access keys. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides temporary security credentials for your session.

To use an IAM role ARN, select **Assume role** for **Preferred manual method**, enter the ARN, and continue to Finish manual setup.


### Finish manual setup [cad-aws-finish-manual]

Once you’ve provided AWS credentials, proceed to **Where to add this integration**:

If you want to monitor an AWS account or organization where you have not yet deployed {{agent}}:

* Select **New Hosts**.
* Name the {{agent}} policy. Use a name that matches the purpose or team of the cloud account or accounts you want to monitor. For example, `dev-aws-account`.
* Click **Save and continue**, then **Add {{agent}} to your hosts**. The **Add agent** wizard appears and provides {{agent}} binaries, which you can download and deploy to your AWS account.

If you want to monitor an AWS account or organization where you have already deployed {{agent}}:

* Select **Existing hosts**.
* Select an agent policy that applies the AWS account you want to monitor.
* Click **Save and continue**.
