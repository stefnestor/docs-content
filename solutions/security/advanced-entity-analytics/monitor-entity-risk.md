# Monitor entity risk and anomalies

The **Entity analytics** page provides a centralized workspace for investigating entity risk across your environment. Use it to explore entity risk scores, surface behavioral anomalies, and prioritize threat investigations.

:::{admonition} Requirements
* This feature requires the appropriate [subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) in {{stack}} or [project feature tier](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md) in {{serverless-short}}.

* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` To access this page, you need the following privileges:
  * `read` for `entities-latest-<space-id>`, `.entities.v2.latest.security_<space-id>-*`, and `risk-score.risk-score-<space-id>`
  * **Read** for the **Management → Saved Objects Management** feature 
* {applies_to}`serverless: ga` If you're using a [custom role](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md), make sure it grants `read` access to all the required index patterns.
* {applies_to}`serverless: removed` {applies_to}`stack: removed 9.3` To get access to this page, turn on the `securitySolution:enablePrivilegedUserMonitoring` [advanced setting](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#access-privileged-user-monitoring).
:::

To access the page:
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Find **Entity analytics** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1-9.3` Find **Entity analytics** → **Overview** in the navigation menu. 

## Threat hunting leads [entity-threat-hunting-leads]
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: preview 9.4+
serverless: preview
```

:::{admonition} Requirements
* To display threat hunting leads, you must [turn on risk scoring](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/turn-on-risk-scoring-engine.md).
* To view or generate threat hunting leads, you need the following privileges:
  * **View leads**: `read` for `.entity_analytics.entity-leads-*`
  * **Generate leads**:
    * `read`, `create_index`, and `write` for `.entity_analytics.entity-leads-*`
    * **Read** for the **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature
:::

AI-generated leads appear at the top of the page, giving threat hunters a curated starting point for their investigations. Leads are refreshed every 24 hours and are derived from observations about entities in the entity store, including:

* Recent increases in entity risk score
* Newly added privileged users
* High numbers of alerts on a given entity

Interact with this section in the following ways:

* Click **Generate** or **Regenerate** to manually trigger a new set of leads without waiting for the next automatic refresh.
* Click **See recent leads** to access and search the most recent leads.
* Click **Hunt with AI** to open an AI-assisted investigation session in Agent Builder without any pre-loaded lead context.
* Click the options menu {icon}`boxes_vertical` to select a connector and toggle **Auto-generate every 24 hours** on or off.
* Click a lead to open an AI-assisted investigation session in Agent Builder with that lead's context pre-loaded.


## Entity risk levels [entity-risk-levels]
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4+
serverless: ga
```

:::{admonition} Requirements
To display entity risk levels, you must [turn on risk scoring](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/turn-on-risk-scoring-engine.md).
:::

This panel shows the distribution of entity risk across your environment, grouped by risk level. For each level, it displays the associated risk score range and the number of entities at that level.


## Recent anomalies [entity-recent-anomalies]
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4+
serverless: ga
```

:::{admonition} Requirements
* To display anomaly results, you must [install and run](/explore-analyze/machine-learning/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-run-jobs.md) one or more [prebuilt {{anomaly-jobs}}](/reference/machine-learning/ootb-ml-jobs-siem.md).
* Loading this panel requires `read` privileges for the `.ml-anomalies-shared*` index and **Read** for the **Machine Learning** {{kib}} feature.
:::

This panel displays recent entity-related anomalies detected by prebuilt {{ml}} jobs. Interact with this section in the following ways:

* Use the **View by** dropdown to group anomalies by **Entity** or **Job ID**.
* Use the **Anomaly score** filters to focus on anomalies by severity range.
* Click **Open in Anomaly Explorer** to access and search all {{ml}} jobs in the **Anomaly Explorer**.


## Entities [entity-entities]

:::{admonition} Requirements
To display the **Entities** section, you must [enable the entity store](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-store.md#enable-entity-store).
:::

This section provides a centralized view of all hosts, users, and services in your environment. It displays entities from the [entity store](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/entity-store.md), which meet any of the following criteria:

* Have been observed by {{elastic-sec}}
* Have been added to {{elastic-sec}} through an integration, such as Active Directory or Okta
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1-9.3` Have an asset criticality assignment


Interact with the table to filter and explore entity data:
:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { stack: ga 9.4+, serverless: ga }

* Use the **Group entities by** dropdown to group entities by **Resolution**, **Entity type**, or a custom field. By default, entities are grouped by **Resolution**: alias entities appear nested under their primary entity, while unresolved entities appear on their own.
* Filter the table by watchlist membership to focus on specific entity groups.
* Sort and filter by any entity store field.
* Click an entity row to expand it and view more details, or open the entity details flyout.
::::

::::{applies-item} stack: ga 9.1-9.3

* Select the **Risk level** dropdown to filter the table by the selected user, host, or service risk level.
* Select the **Criticality** dropdown to filter the table by the selected asset criticality level.
* Select the **Source** dropdown to filter the table by the data source.
* Click the **View details** icon ({icon}`expand` ) to open the entity details flyout.

:::{note}
The **Entities** table only shows a subset of the data available for each entity. You can query the `.entities.v1.latest.security_user_<space-id>`, `.entities.v1.latest.security_host_<space-id>`, and `.entities.v1.latest.security_service_<space-id>` indices to see all the fields for each entity in the entity store.
:::


Entity data from different sources appears in the **Entities** section based on the following timelines:

* When you first enable the entity store, only data stored in the last 24 hours is processed. After that, data is processed continuously.
* Observed events from the {{elastic-sec}} default data view are processed in near real-time.
* Entity Analytics data, such as entity risk scores and asset criticality (including bulk asset criticality upload), is also processed in near real-time.
* The availability of entities extracted from Entity Analytics integrations depends on the specific integration. Refer to [Active Directory Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_ad), [Microsoft Entra ID Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_entra_id), and [Okta Entity Analytics](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/entityanalytics_okta) for more details.
