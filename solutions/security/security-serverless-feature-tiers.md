# {{elastic-sec}} feature tiers

{{sec-serverless}} projects are available in the following tiers, each with a carefully selected set of features to enable security operations:

* **Elastic AI SOC Engine (EASE)**: Use Elastic's AI-powered threat hunting and alert triage capabilities to complement a third-party SIEM deployment. 
* **Security Analytics Essentials**: Everything most organizations need to operationalize traditional SIEM.
* **Security Analytics Complete**: All the capabilities included in **Security Analytics Essentials**, plus additional features that provide a more complete toolset.

Both of the **Security Analytics** tiers have **Add-on options** for endpoint protection and cloud protection.

## Upgrade to a higher feature tier [sec-subscription-upgrade]

:::{warning}
Upgrading a project to a higher feature tier cannot always be efficiently reversed: downgrading to a lower tier immediately makes some features unavailable, and data associated with those features can be permanently deleted.
:::

To access the additional features available in a higher feature tier:

1. From the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co), select **Manage** next to the {{serverless-short}} project you want to upgrade.
1. Next to **Project features**, select **Edit**.
1. Select your desired feature tier.
1. Select **Save** to complete the upgrade.
