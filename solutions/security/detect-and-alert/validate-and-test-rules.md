# Validate and test rules

Before enabling a new detection rule in production, validate that it detects what you intend, at a volume your team can handle, without generating excessive false positives. The steps below apply to any [rule type](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-types.md).

## Preview rules against historical data [validate-historical-data]

Use the rule preview feature to test your rule's query against a historical time range before enabling it. This shows you what the rule would have detected without creating actual alerts.

While [creating or editing a rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-rule-ui.md) in the UI, use the rule preview. You can select a time range that represents normal activity in your environment. For example, a range of 7 to 14 days captures both weekday and weekend patterns.

When reviewing the rule preview results, look for:

- **Expected true positives.** Does the rule detect the activity it's designed to catch? If you have known-good test data (for example, from red team exercises), confirm those events appear in the results.
- **Obvious false positives.** Do any results represent legitimate activity? If so, refine the query or plan to add [exceptions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/add-manage-exceptions.md) before enabling the rule.
- **Missing detections.** If the rule produces no results and you expected it to, check that the required data sources are being ingested and that your index patterns are correct.

::::{tip}
If the rule uses [alert suppression](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/alert-suppression.md), use the rule preview to visualize how suppression affects the alert output. This helps you confirm that suppression is grouping events as expected before the rule goes live.

## Validate using AI [validate-using-ai]

Elastic's AI chat experiences can review your rule's logic and suggest improvements. You can use AI to check whether a query is too broad, identify likely false positive patterns, verify MITRE ATT&CK alignment, or evaluate scheduling and suppression settings.

With [AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md), you can describe a rule or paste its query into a chat and ask validation-related questions such as:

- "Does this query match more broadly than intended? What legitimate activity could it catch?"
- "What MITRE ATT&CK techniques does this rule cover, and are there gaps?"
- "Is a 5-minute scheduling interval appropriate for this data source, or would a longer interval reduce noise without missing threats?"

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` With [Agent Builder](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md), refer to [Create and refine detection rules in Agent Builder](/solutions/security/ai/agent-builder/agent-builder.md#create-and-refine-detection-rules-in-agent-builder) to attach a detection rule and provide the full rule definition as context. This removes the need to copy and paste and gives the agent access to all rule fields when answering your questions.

## Run manual tests [manual-test-run]

For rules that are already enabled, you can [manually run](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md#manually-run-rules) them over a specific time range to test behavior against real data. Unlike preview, manual runs create actual alerts and trigger rule actions.

Manual runs are useful when:

- You want to test a rule against a specific incident window where you know what happened.
- You need to fill a gap in rule coverage after a rule was temporarily not running.
- You want to verify that a rule change produces the expected results in production.

::::{important}
Manual runs activate all configured [rule actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-notifications) except **Summary of alerts** actions that run at a custom frequency. If you want to test without sending notifications, [snooze the rule's actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md#snooze-rule-actions) first.
::::

### Test in a dedicated space

For more isolated testing, create a dedicated [{{kib}} space](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md) for rule development. This lets you test rules with manual runs without affecting production alerts or triggering notifications to your team.

1. Create a new space for testing.
2. Copy or recreate the rule in the test space.
3. Run manual tests and review alerts without impacting production workflows.
4. Once validated, recreate or import the rule into your production space.

This approach is especially useful when testing rule changes that might generate high alert volumes or when multiple team members are developing rules simultaneously.

## Test rules externally with Detection-as-Code [test-rules-dac]

If you manage rules outside of the {{kib}} UI, you can use [Detection-as-Code](https://dac-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dac_concept_and_workflows.html) (DaC) workflows to test rules before deploying them. The Elastic Security Labs team maintains the [detection-rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) repo, which provides tooling for developing, testing, and releasing detection rules programmatically.

DaC workflows let you:

- Validate rule syntax and schema before deployment.
- Run unit tests against rule logic in a CI/CD pipeline.
- Track rule changes in version control for auditability.

To get started, refer to the [DaC documentation](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/README.md#detections-as-code-dac). For managing rules through the API, refer to [Using the API](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-api.md).

% ## Estimate alert volume [estimate-alert-volume]
%
% High-volume rules can overwhelm analysts and degrade rule execution performance. Before enabling a rule, estimate its expected alert rate.
%
% 1. Review the preview result count from the historical validation step. Divide by the number of days in your preview range to get a daily estimate.
% 2. Compare this estimate against your team's capacity. A rule generating hundreds of alerts per day may need to be narrowed before it delivers value.
% 3. If volume is too high, consider:
%    - Narrowing the query to be more specific.
%    - Adding [alert suppression](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/alert-suppression.md) to deduplicate repeated alerts for the same entity.
%    - Adjusting the rule's schedule interval if a longer interval is acceptable for the threat you're detecting.
%
% ## Assess false positive rate [assess-false-positives]
%
% A rule that produces mostly false positives trains analysts to ignore it. Evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio before going live.
%
% 1. Sample 20 to 50 results from your preview and classify each as a true positive, false positive, or uncertain.
% 2. If more than half are false positives, refine the rule before enabling it. Common adjustments include:
%    - Adding field constraints to the query (for example, excluding known service accounts or internal IP ranges).
%    - Preparing [exceptions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-exceptions.md) for specific known-safe cases.
%    - Switching to a more targeted [rule type](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/choose-the-right-rule-type.md) if the current type is too broad for the detection goal.
% 3. Document the false positive patterns you find. This helps other analysts understand the rule's limitations and speeds up triage.
%
% ## Shadow deployment [shadow-deployment]
%
% Shadow deployment means enabling a rule in production but suppressing its notifications so you can observe real alert output before analysts are paged.
%
% 1. Create and enable the rule normally.
% 2. [Snooze the rule's actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md#snooze-rule-actions) to suppress notifications. The rule runs on its schedule and writes alerts to the index, but no emails, Slack messages, or webhook calls are sent.
% 3. Let the rule run for a representative period (typically 3 to 7 days).
% 4. Review the alerts it generates in the **Alerts** table. Evaluate:
%    - Is the volume manageable?
%    - Are the alerts actionable?
%    - Do any patterns suggest the query needs further tuning or exceptions?
% 5. Once you're confident in the rule's output, unsnooze the actions to begin sending notifications.
%
% ::::{tip}
% Shadow deployment is especially useful for rules that are difficult to validate with historical data alone, such as [threshold rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/threshold.md) where volume depends on live traffic patterns, or [{{ml}} rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/machine-learning.md) where anomaly baselines evolve over time.
% ::::
%
% ## Post-enablement monitoring [post-enablement-monitoring]
%
% Validation doesn't end when a rule goes live. Monitor newly enabled rules closely during their first weeks in production.
%
% - **Check execution health.** Use the [Rule Monitoring tab](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/monitor-rule-executions.md) to confirm the rule is executing successfully and not timing out or failing.
% - **Track alert volume trends.** A sudden spike or drop in alert volume can indicate a change in the data source, a rule misconfiguration, or an emerging incident.
% - **Collect analyst feedback.** Ask the analysts triaging the rule's alerts whether they find them actionable. If a rule consistently produces alerts that are closed without investigation, it needs further tuning.
% - **Review after one to two weeks.** Revisit the rule's configuration after it has run through a full operational cycle. Adjust the query, exceptions, suppression, or schedule based on what you've learned.
