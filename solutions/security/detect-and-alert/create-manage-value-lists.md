# Create and manage value lists [value-lists-exceptions]

Value lists hold multiple values of the same {{es}} [data type](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/field-data-types.md), such as IP addresses or keywords. Use them to [define exceptions](add-manage-exceptions.md) with the `is in list` and `is not in list` operators so that a rule skips alerts for any matching value. You can also use a value list as the [indicator match index](indicator-match.md#using-value-lists) when creating an indicator match rule.

:::{admonition} Endpoint rule exceptions
Value lists cannot be used to define endpoint rule exceptions.
:::

## Prerequisites

To create and manage value lists, your role must have the required privileges. Refer to [Manage exception value lists](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-privileges.md#detections-privileges-manage-value-lists) for details.

## Supported list types and formats [value-list-types]

You can create value lists with the following types:

| List type | Description | Example values |
|---|---|---|
| Keywords | Keyword strings. Many [ECS fields](ecs://reference/ecs-field-reference.md) are keywords. | `svchost.exe`, `admin@example.com` |
| IP addresses | Single IP addresses. | `192.168.1.5` |
| IP ranges | IP ranges in CIDR or dash notation. | `10.0.0.0/8`, `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.4` |
| Text | Free-form text strings. | `error: unauthorized access` |

### IP format reference [ip-value-list-formats]

When uploading an **IP addresses** or **IP ranges** value list, each line (or CSV field) must contain exactly one value. The following formats are accepted:

| List type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| IP addresses | Single IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) | `192.168.1.5`, `::1` |
| IP ranges | CIDR notation | `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.1.0/24` |
| IP ranges | Dash (range) notation | `10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255` |

The notation you choose for IP range lists affects size-based rule compatibility. Refer to [Value list size and rule type compatibility](#value-list-compatibility) for details.

## Value list size and rule type compatibility [value-list-compatibility]

A value list's size and data type determine which rule types can use it. Lists are classified as either *small* or *large*.

### Small value lists

Small value lists are compatible with all rule types, including threshold rules.

* **Keyword** or **IP address** lists with fewer than 65,536 items
* **IP range** lists with fewer than 65,536 items in CIDR notation (for example, `127.0.0.1/32`)
* **IP range** lists with fewer than 200 items in dash notation (for example, `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.4`)

### Large value lists

Large value lists are compatible only with custom query, saved query, machine learning, and indicator match rules.

* **Keyword**, **IP address**, or **IP range** lists with 65,536 or more items (or 200+ items for IP ranges using dash notation)
* **Text** lists of any size

::::{admonition} Threshold rules and value lists
:class: warning
Threshold rules only support exceptions that use small value lists. If a value list exceeds the size thresholds above, or if it uses the **Text** type, the exception will not be applied to a threshold rule. You may see a warning when this occurs.
::::

## Create a value list [create-value-lists]

1. Prepare a `txt` or `csv` file with all the values you want to include. If you use a `txt` file, new lines act as delimiters.

    ::::{important}
    * All values in the file must be of the same {{es}} type.
    * Wildcards are not supported in value lists. Values must be literal values.
    * The maximum accepted file size is 9 million bytes.
    ::::

2. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
3. Click **Manage value lists**.
4. From the window, select the list type (**Keywords**, **IP addresses**, **IP ranges**, or **Text**) from the **Type of value list** drop-down.
5. Drag or select the `csv` or `txt` file that contains the values.
6. Click **Import value list**.

::::{note}
If you import a file with a name that already exists, a new list is not created. The imported values are added to the existing list instead.
::::


## Edit a value list [edit-value-lists]

1. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Click **Manage value lists**. The **Manage value lists** window opens.
3. In the **Value lists** table, click the value list you want to edit.

### Value list editor actions

| Action | How to do it |
|--------|--------------|
| Filter items | Use the KQL search bar. Filter by `keyword`, `ip_range`, `ip`, or `text` depending on list type (for example, `keyword:*gmail.com`). You can also filter by `updated_by` or `updated_at`. |
| Add individual item | Click **Create list item** > _enter value_ > **Add list item** |
| Bulk upload items | Drag or select a `.csv` or `.txt` file > **Upload** |
| Edit a value | Click the edit icon {icon}`pencil` > _make changes_ > click the save icon {icon}`check` |
| Remove a value | Click the remove value icon {icon}`trash` |


::::{tip}
You can also edit value lists while creating and managing exceptions that use value lists.
::::

## Export or remove a value list [export-remove-value-lists]

1. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Click **Manage value lists**. The **Manage value lists** window opens.
3. From the **Value lists** table, you can:

    - Click the **Export value list** icon {icon}`export` to export the value list.
    - Click the **Remove value list** icon {icon}`trash` to delete the value list.

## Configure upload limits [adv-list-settings]

You can configure limits for uploading value lists to {{elastic-sec}} by editing your [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md) [configuration file](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/general-settings.md) or your {{kib}} cloud instance.

`xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`
:   Maximum bytes allowed for uploading value lists. Default: `9000000`. Maximum: `100000000`.

    For every 10 megabytes, reserve an additional 1 gigabyte of RAM for {{kib}}. For example, a {{kib}} instance with 2 GB of RAM can support up to 20 MB (`20000000`).

`xpack.lists.importBufferSize`
:   Buffer size for uploading value lists. Default: `1000`.

    Increase this value to improve throughput (uses more memory), or decrease it to reduce memory usage (slower uploads).
