# Detections requirements

To use the [Detections feature](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert.md), you first need to configure a few settings. You also need the appropriate [{{stack}} subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) or [{{serverless-short}} project feature tier](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md) to send [notifications](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-detection-rule.md#rule-notifications) when detection alerts are generated. Additionally, there are some [advanced settings](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-requirements.md#adv-list-settings) used to configure {{kib}} [value list](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-manage-value-lists.md) upload limits.

::::{important}
Several steps are **only** required for **self-managed** {{stack}} deployments. If you’re using an Elastic Cloud deployment, you only need to [enable detections](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-requirements.md#enable-detections-ui).
::::

## Configure self-managed {{stack}} deployments [detections-on-prem-requirements]

```yaml {applies_to}
  deployment:
    self:
```

These steps are only required for **self-managed** deployments:

- HTTPS must be configured for communication between [{{es}} and {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security-plus-https.md#encrypt-kibana-http).
- In [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md):

  Add the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value of at least 32 characters. For example:

  `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

- In [`elasticsearch.yml`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md):
  - Set the `xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. Refer to [General security settings](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/security-settings.md#general-security-settings) for more information.
  - If the `search.allow_expensive_queries` setting is set to `false`, remove it. If set to its default value of `true` or not included in the `elasticsearch.yml` file, you don't need to make changes. This setting must be `true` for key detection features, such as [alerting rules](/explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/alerting-setup.md#alerting-prerequisites) and rule exceptions, to work.

::::{important}
After changing the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value and restarting {{kib}}, you must restart all detection rules.
::::

## Enable and access detections [enable-detections-ui]

```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga
serverless: ga
```

To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled, your role must have access to rules and alerts, and your {{kib}} space must have **Data View Management** [feature visibility](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md). If your role doesn’t have the cluster and index privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your {{kib}} space, which will turn it on for you.

::::{note}
For instructions about using {{ml}} jobs and rules, refer to [Machine learning job and rule requirements](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/machine-learning-job-rule-requirements.md).

### Authorization [alerting-auth-model]

```yaml {applies_to}
stack:
```

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an [API key](/deploy-manage/api-keys/elasticsearch-api-keys.md) associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

::::{important}
If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.

## Configure list upload limits [adv-list-settings]

```yaml {applies_to}
stack:
```

You can set limits to the number of bytes and the buffer size used to upload [value lists](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-manage-value-lists.md) to {{elastic-sec}}.

To set the value:

1. Open [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md) [configuration file](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/general-settings.md) or edit your {{kib}} cloud instance.
2. Add any of these settings and their required values:

   - `xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`: Sets the number of bytes allowed for uploading {{elastic-sec}} value lists (default `9000000`, maximum `100000000`). For every 10 megabytes, it is recommended to have an additional 1 gigabyte of RAM reserved for Kibana.

     For example, on a Kibana instance with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can set this value up to 20000000 (20 megabytes).

   - `xpack.lists.importBufferSize`: Sets the buffer size used for uploading {{elastic-sec}} value lists (default `1000`). Change the value if you’re experiencing slow upload speeds or larger than wanted memory usage when uploading value lists. Set to a higher value to increase throughput at the expense of using more Kibana memory, or a lower value to decrease throughput and reduce memory usage.
