# Manage detection alerts [security-alerts-manage]

The Alerts page is your central hub for triaging and investigating detection alerts. Filter alerts to focus on what matters, change statuses to track progress, and take actions to investigate or respond.

| [Change status](#detection-alert-status) | Mark as open, acknowledged, or closed |
| [Add to case](/explore-analyze/cases/attach-objects-to-cases.md) | Attach alert to a new or existing case |

### Change alert status [detection-alert-status]

Alert statuses track investigation progress:

| Open | Needs investigation (default view) |
| Acknowledged | Under active investigation |
| Closed | Resolved |

**To change status:**

| Scope | How to do it |
|-------|--------------|
| Single alert | **More actions** icon {icon}`boxes_horizontal` > select status |
| Multiple alerts | Select alerts > **Selected *x* alerts** > select status |
| Grouped alerts | **Take actions** menu on group row > select status |
| From flyout | **Take action** > select status |

:::

#### Closing reasons
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.2
serverless: ga
```

When closing alerts, you can specify a reason:

| Reason | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| Close without reason | No specific categorization needed |
| Duplicate | Alert duplicates another alert |
| False positive | Normal activity, not a security issue |
| True positive | Real incident that's been resolved |
| Benign positive | Real activity but acceptable/not actionable |
| Other | Other reasons |

::::{tip}
:applies_to: {stack: ga 9.4+, serverless: ga}
You can add your own closing reason options by updating the `securitySolution:alertCloseReasons` advanced setting. Refer to [Add custom alert closing reasons](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#custom-alert-closing-reasons) for more information.
::::

The closing reason is stored in `kibana.alert.workflow_reason` and can be used for filtering. Reopening an alert removes this field.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` You can also set an alert closing reason when you [close an {{elastic-sec}} case with sync enabled](/solutions/security/investigate/security-cases.md#cases-set-closing-reason).

### Run a workflow from an alert [run-workflow-from-alert]
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4+
serverless: ga
```

You can run an [Elastic workflow](/explore-analyze/workflows.md) directly from an alert to trigger an on-demand response or investigation. To use this feature, make sure you meet the [workflows prerequisites](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/build-your-first-workflow.md#workflows-prerequisites).

To run a workflow on an individual alert, do one of the following:

* In the Alerts table, click **More actions** ({icon}`boxes_vertical`) in an alert's row, then click **Run workflow**. Use the search bar to select a workflow, then click **Run workflow**.
* In an alert's details flyout, click **Take action → Run workflow**. Use the search bar to select a workflow, then click **Run workflow**.

::::{note}
You can select only enabled workflows.
::::

To run a workflow on multiple alerts, select the alerts, then click **Selected *x* alerts** at the upper-left above the table. Click **Run workflow**, select a workflow, then click **Run workflow**.

### Apply alert tags [apply-alert-tags]

Tags help organize alerts into filterable categories.

| Task | How to do it |
|------|--------------|
| Tag single alert | **More actions** icon {icon}`boxes_horizontal` > **Apply alert tags** |
| Tag multiple alerts | Select alerts > **Selected *x* alerts** > **Apply alert tags** |
| Tag from flyout | **Take action** > **Apply alert tags** |
| Filter by tag | KQL: `kibana.alert.workflow_tags: "False Positive"` |
| Show tags column | **Fields** > add `kibana.alert.workflow_tags` |
| Manage tag options | [Configure `securitySolution:alertTags`](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#manage-alert-tags) |


### Assign users to alerts [assign-users-to-alerts]

Assign analysts to alerts they should investigate.

::::{important}
Users are not notified when assigned or unassigned.
::::

| Task | How to do it |
|------|--------------|
| Assign to single alert | **More actions** icon {icon}`boxes_horizontal` > **Assign alert** > select users |
| Assign to multiple alerts | Select alerts > **Selected *x* alerts** > **Assign alert** |
| Assign from flyout | **Take action** > **Assign alert**, or click the assign icon at top |
| Unassign all users | **More actions** icon {icon}`boxes_horizontal` > **Unassign alert** |
| Show assignees column | **Fields** > add `kibana.alert.workflow_assignee_ids` |
| Filter by assignee | Click **Assignees** filter above table |

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-alert-assigned-alerts.png
:alt: Alert assignees in the Alerts table
:screenshot:
:::


### Add rule exception [add-exception-from-alerts]

Create an [exception](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-exceptions.md) to prevent a rule from generating similar alerts.

| Location | How to do it |
|----------|--------------|
| Alerts table | **More actions** icon {icon}`boxes_horizontal` > **Add exception** |
| Alert details flyout | **Take action** > **Add rule exception** |


### Investigate in Timeline [signals-to-timelines]

| Scope | How to do it |
|-------|--------------|
| Single alert | Click **Investigate in timeline** button in table, or **Take action** > **Investigate in timeline** |
| Multiple alerts | Select alerts (up to 2,000) > **Selected *x* alerts** > **Investigate in timeline** |

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-timeline-button.png
:alt: Investigate in timeline button
:screenshot:
:::

::::{tip}
For [threshold rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-rule-ui.md) alerts, Timeline shows all matching events, not only those that crossed the threshold.
::::

If the rule uses a Timeline template, dropzone query values are replaced with the alert's actual field values.


## Clean up alerts [clean-up-alerts-sec]

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4+, preview 9.1-9.3
serverless: ga
```

Manage the size of alert indices in your space by clearing out alerts that are older or infrequently accessed. You can do this by [running an alert cleanup task](../../../explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/view-alerts.md#clean-up-alerts), which deletes alerts according to the criteria that you define.
