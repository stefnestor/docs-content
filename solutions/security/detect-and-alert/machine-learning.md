# {{ml-cap}} rules [ml-rule-type]

{{ml-cap}} rules generate alerts when a {{ml}} {{anomaly-job}} discovers an anomaly that exceeds a defined score threshold. Unlike other rule types, {{ml}} rules do not require you to write a query. Instead, they rely on {{ml}} jobs that continuously model normal behavior and flag deviations.

### When to use a {{ml}} rule

{{ml-cap}} rules are the right fit when:

* You want to detect **behavioral anomalies** that are difficult to express as static queries, such as unusual login times, atypical data transfer volumes, or rare process executions for a given user or host.
* A {{ml}} job is already active (or you plan to enable one) that models the relevant behavior.
* You want **adaptive detection** that automatically adjusts to changing baselines without manual threshold tuning.

{{ml-cap}} rules are **not** the best fit when:

* You can define the exact pattern you're looking for. Use a [custom query rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/custom-query.md) or [EQL rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/eql.md) instead.
* You need a count-based threshold. Use a [threshold rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/threshold.md) instead.
* You need to compare events against threat intelligence. Use an [indicator match rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/indicator-match.md) instead.

## Requirements

{{ml-cap}} rules require the appropriate [{{stack}} subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) or [{{serverless-short}} project feature tier](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md), and you must have the [`machine_learning_admin`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/roles.md#built-in-roles-ml-admin) role in {{stack}} or the appropriate [user role](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md) in {{serverless-short}}. You also need at least one {{ml}} {{anomaly-job}} active or configured to start.

For an overview of using {{ml}} with {{elastic-sec}}, refer to [{{anomaly-detect-cap}}](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/anomaly-detection.md).

## Manage {{ml}} jobs for detection rules

{{ml-cap}} rules depend on their associated {{ml}} jobs running continuously. If a job stops, the rule cannot evaluate anomaly results and won't generate alerts. You can manage job status in two ways: from the {{ml}} jobs setting UI or the rule's details page.

### ML job settings interface

{{ml-cap}} jobs associated with {{elastic-sec}} prebuilt rules are managed in a dedicated interface:

1. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Select the settings menu in the upper-right corner of the page, then select **ML job settings**.

From there you can view, start, and stop all {{ml}} jobs associated with prebuilt detection rules.

::::{note}
You can also create custom {{ml}} jobs in the {{ml-app}} app and reference them when creating custom {{ml}} rules. Custom jobs are managed in the {{ml-app}} app, not the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page settings menu.
::::

### Rule's details page

You can also check and control job status for a specific rule:

1. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md), and select the rule name in the Rules table.
2. In the **Definition** section of the rule's details page, check whether the required {{ml}} jobs are running.
3. Use the toggles to start or stop each job.

If a required {{ml}} job isn't running, an error indicator appears in the **Last response** column of the Rules table. Select the indicator to see which jobs are affected.

## Configuring effective {{ml}} rules [craft-ml]

### Selecting {{ml}} jobs

Select one or more {{ml}} jobs that model the behavior you want to detect. {{elastic-sec}} ships with prebuilt jobs covering common use cases:

* **Unusual login activity.** Detects logins at unusual times or from unusual locations.
* **Rare process execution.** Surfaces processes that rarely execute on a given host.
* **DNS tunneling.** Identifies unusually high DNS query volumes or rare query patterns.

If a selected job is not currently active, it starts automatically when you enable the rule.

### Setting the anomaly score threshold

The anomaly score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate stronger deviations from normal behavior. Guidelines for setting the threshold:

| Threshold range | Effect |
|---|---|
| 25-50 | Casts a wide net. Generates more alerts, including moderate anomalies. Suitable for initial exploration of a new job. |
| 50-75 | Balanced. Surfaces significant anomalies while filtering out low-confidence results. A good starting point for most rules. |
| 75-100 | High confidence only. Generates fewer alerts but each one represents a strong deviation. Best for mature jobs with well-understood baselines. |

### Tuning and noise reduction

{{ml}} rules can be noisy when a job is newly deployed or the underlying data shifts. Use these techniques to reduce false positives:

* **Raise the anomaly score threshold** if the job is generating too many low-confidence alerts.
* **Add [rule exceptions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-exceptions.md)** to suppress alerts from known-benign anomalies, such as scheduled maintenance windows or expected batch processes.
* **Allow the job time to learn.** Most jobs need at least two weeks of data before their baselines stabilize. Anomalies flagged during the initial learning period are less reliable.

### Understanding {{ml}} alerts

{{ml}} alerts differ from other alert types:

* Alerts are generated from **anomaly results**, not raw source events. The alert contains anomaly metadata (score, job ID, influencers, bucket time) rather than the original event fields.
* When configuring **alert suppression**, only anomaly fields are available because source event fields are not present in the anomaly results.
* **Severity and risk score overrides** based on source event fields are not applicable. Consider mapping the anomaly score to severity using severity override on anomaly-specific fields.

::::{tip}
**See it in practice.** These prebuilt rules use {{ml}} detection:

* **Anomalous Process For a Linux Population.** Uses a rare-process {{ml}} job to surface processes that are unusual across a fleet of Linux hosts.
* **Unusual Login Activity.** Triggers when a user logs in at unusual times or from unusual source IPs, based on a login-activity {{ml}} job.
* **Spike in Network Traffic To a Country.** Detects sudden increases in outbound network traffic to a specific country, useful for identifying data exfiltration.

## Annotated examples [ml-examples]

The following examples use the [detections API](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-api.md) request format to show how {{ml}} rules are defined. Each example is followed by a breakdown of the {{ml}}-specific fields. For common fields like `name`, `severity`, and `interval`, refer to the [detections API documentation]({{kib-apis}}group/endpoint-detection-engine-rules-api).

### Single {{ml}} job [ml-example-single-job]

This rule monitors a rare-process {{ml}} job for anomalies on Linux hosts.

```json
{
  "type": "machine_learning",
  "name": "Anomalous process execution on Linux",
  "description": "Alerts when a machine learning job detects a rare process execution on a Linux host.",
  "machine_learning_job_id": "v3_linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts",
  "anomaly_threshold": 75,
  "severity": "low",
  "risk_score": 21,
  "interval": "15m",
  "from": "now-16m"
}
```

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"machine_learning"` | Identifies this as a {{ml}} rule. No `query`, `language`, or `index` fields are used. |
| `machine_learning_job_id` | `"v3_linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts"` | The ID of the {{anomaly-job}} to monitor. Accepts a single string or an array of strings for multiple jobs. If the job is not running, it starts automatically when the rule is enabled. |
| `anomaly_threshold` | `75` | Minimum anomaly score (0-100) required to trigger an alert. A score of 75 surfaces only strong deviations. Lower values (25-50) cast a wider net; higher values (75-100) produce fewer, higher-confidence alerts. |
| `interval` / `from` | `"15m"` / `"now-16m"` | {{ml-cap}} rules often use a longer interval than query-based rules because anomaly results are produced on the job's bucket-span schedule rather than in real time. |

### Multiple {{ml}} jobs with alert suppression [ml-example-multi-job]

This rule monitors several login-related {{ml}} jobs and suppresses repeated alerts by user.

```json
{
  "type": "machine_learning",
  "name": "Unusual login activity detected",
  "description": "Alerts when any login-related ML job detects anomalous authentication behavior.",
  "machine_learning_job_id": [
    "auth_high_count_logon_events",
    "auth_rare_source_ip_for_a_user",
    "auth_high_count_logon_fails"
  ],
  "anomaly_threshold": 50,
  "severity": "medium",
  "risk_score": 47,
  "alert_suppression": {
    "group_by": ["user.name"],
    "duration": { "value": 1, "unit": "h" },
    "missing_fields_strategy": "suppress"
  },
  "interval": "15m",
  "from": "now-16m"
}
```

| Field | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `machine_learning_job_id` | `["auth_high_count_logon_events", ...]` | An array of job IDs. The rule monitors all three jobs and fires when any one produces an anomaly exceeding the threshold. |
| `alert_suppression.group_by` | `["user.name"]` | Groups anomaly alerts by user to reduce noise when the same user triggers multiple jobs or repeated anomalies. Only anomaly-result fields (including influencer fields configured in the {{ml}} job) are available for suppression. |
| `alert_suppression.duration` | `{ "value": 1, "unit": "h" }` | Suppression window of 1 hour. Accepted units are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), and `h` (hours). |

## {{ml-cap}} rule field reference [ml-fields]

The following settings appear in the **Define rule** section when creating a {{ml}} rule. For settings shared across all rule types, refer to [Rule settings reference](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md).

**{{ml-cap}} jobs**
:   The {{anomaly-jobs}} whose results the rule evaluates. Select one or more jobs. If a selected job is not active, it starts automatically when the rule is enabled.

**Anomaly score threshold**
:   The minimum anomaly score (0-100) above which the rule generates alerts. Only anomalies that meet or exceed this score trigger alerts.

**Suppress alerts by** (optional)
:   Reduce repeated or duplicate alerts by grouping them on one or more fields. Only anomaly fields are available for suppression because {{ml}} alerts do not contain source event fields. For details, refer to [Alert suppression](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/alert-suppression.md).
