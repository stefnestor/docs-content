# Turn on detections [enable-detections-ui]

Before you can create rules, manage alerts, or use other [detection capabilities](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert.md), you need to enable the detections feature. This page walks you through the required setup for your deployment type and shows you how to turn on detections.

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} {{serverless-full}}

The detections feature is turned on by default in {{serverless-short}} projects. Your access level depends on your assigned role.

| Access level | Roles |
| --- | --- |
| Full access (manage rules, alerts, exceptions) | Editor, SOC Manager, Detections Eng, Tier 3 Analyst, Platform Engineer |
| Read-only (only view rules and alerts) | Viewer, Tier 1 Analyst, Tier 2 Analyst |

Refer to [Predefined roles](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-privileges.md#predefined-serverless-roles-detections) for a list of predefined roles with detection privileges.

::::::

::::::{tab-item} {{ecloud}}

To activate the detection engine, open the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md). The engine initializes automatically when a user with [sufficient privileges](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-privileges.md) opens the page.

::::{note}
The page was renamed from **Rules** to **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in versions 9.3.1 and 9.2.6.
::::

No additional configuration is required.

::::::

::::::{tab-item} Self-managed {{stack}}

Complete these steps to turn on the detections feature in your space.

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Enable HTTPS
Configure HTTPS for communication between [{{es}} and {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security-plus-https.md#encrypt-kibana-http).
::::

::::{step} Configure {{kib}}
In your [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md) file, add an encryption key with at least 32 alphanumeric characters:

```yaml
xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'
```

:::{important}
After changing the encryption key and restarting {{kib}}, you must restart all detection rules.
:::
::::

::::{step} Configure {{es}}
In your [`elasticsearch.yml`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md) file:

1. Set `xpack.security.enabled` to `true`. Refer to [General security settings](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/security-settings.md#general-security-settings) for more information.

2. Ensure `search.allow_expensive_queries` is `true` (the default). If it's set to `false`, remove that setting.
::::

::::{step} Enable detections
1. Go to the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. The detection engine initializes when a user with [sufficient privileges](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detections-privileges.md) visits the page.

::::{note}
To enable detections in multiple spaces, visit the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page in each space.
