# Update Elastic prebuilt rules [update-prebuilt-rules]

Elastic regularly updates prebuilt rules to optimize their performance and ensure they detect the latest threats and techniques. This page explains how to review and apply updates to your installed prebuilt rules.

:::{admonition} Air-gapped environments
For deployments without internet access, refer to [Prebuilt rules in air-gapped environments](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/prebuilt-rules-airgapped.md).
:::

## Update availability [update-availability]

When updated versions are available for your installed prebuilt rules, the **Rule Updates** tab appears on the **{{siem-rules-ui}}** page.

::::{note}
The page was renamed from **Rules** to **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in versions 9.3.1 and 9.2.6.
::::

:::{admonition} Automatic updates
On {{stack}}, automatic updates are supported for the current {{elastic-sec}} version and the two previous minor releases. For example, if you're on version 9.0, you can use the Rules UI to update prebuilt rules until version 9.3 is released. After that, you can still manually download and install updates, but must upgrade {{elastic-sec}} to receive automatic updates again.
:::

## Review updates [review-updates]

Before applying updates, you can examine what's changing in each rule.

1. Find **{{siem-rules-ui}}** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, select the **Rule Updates** tab.

    ::::{note}
    The **Rule Updates** tab doesn't appear if all your installed prebuilt rules are up to date.
    ::::

3. Select a rule name to open the rule update flyout and review the changes.

All subscriptions can preview incoming updates by selecting the **Elastic update overview** tab for a field-by-field view, or the **JSON view** tab for a full rule comparison. Both tabs display side-by-side comparisons of the **Current rule** and the **Elastic update** version. Deleted characters are highlighted in red; added characters are highlighted in green.

::::{dropdown} Additional options with Enterprise subscription
:name: enterprise-review-options

With an Enterprise subscription on {{stack}} or a Security Analytics Complete project on {{serverless-short}}, you also have access to:

* **Compare different versions**: Use the **Diff view** drop-down menu to compare different versions of a rule field. For example, compare changes you made to the current version with changes from the incoming Elastic update.

    ::::{note}
    If you haven't updated the rule in a while, its original version might be unavailable for comparison. You can avoid this by updating prebuilt rules regularly.
    ::::

* **Check update status**: View the status of the entire rule update and for each field being changed. Refer to [Field update statuses](#rule-field-update-statuses) for status definitions.

* **Edit the final update**: Change the update that will be applied to any field. Go to the **Final update** section, make your changes, and save them.

    ::::{important}
    Elastic updates containing a rule type change cannot be edited. Duplicate the rule before updating if you need to preserve your modifications.

## Preserve customizations during updates [preserve-customizations]

If you've customized prebuilt rules and want to preserve your changes when applying updates, review the guidance for your subscription level below. The update process differs based on your subscription.

::::{dropdown} Enterprise / Security Analytics Complete
:name: enterprise-modified-rules

With an Enterprise subscription on {{stack}} or a Security Analytics Complete project on {{serverless-short}}, {{elastic-sec}} attempts to merge your changes with the Elastic update. If conflicts arise:

* **Auto-resolved conflicts**: {{elastic-sec}} suggests a resolution for your review. The field displays a `Review required` status.
* **Unresolved conflicts**: You must manually select how to resolve the conflict. The field displays an `Action required` status.

Refer to [Resolve update conflicts](#resolve-reduce-rule-conflicts) for guidance on handling conflicts.

::::{tip}
Use the **Modified/Unmodified** drop-down menu in the **Rule Updates** tab to filter for modified rules that may need attention.
::::

::::

::::{dropdown} Basic–Platinum / Security Analytics Essentials
:name: basic-modified-rules

With a Basic–Platinum subscription on {{stack}} or a Security Analytics Essentials project on {{serverless-short}}, you cannot edit prebuilt rules directly. If you previously had an Enterprise subscription and modified prebuilt rules before downgrading, updates will overwrite those modifications with the Elastic version. To preserve your changes before updating:

1. [Duplicate the rule](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/customize-prebuilt-rules.md#duplicate-prebuilt-rules).
2. Apply the update to the original prebuilt rule.
3. Continue using your duplicated rule with your customizations.

::::


## Apply updates [apply-updates]

From the **Rule Updates** tab, do one of the following:

* **Update all available rules**: Select **Update all**. If any rules have conflicts (Enterprise only), you are prompted to resolve them first.
* **Update a single rule**: Select **Update rule** for that rule.
* **Update multiple rules**: Select the rules and select **Update *x* selected rule(s)**.

::::{tip}
Use the search bar and **Tags** filter to find specific rules. For example, filter by `OS: Windows` if your environment only includes Windows endpoints. For more on tag categories, refer to [Prebuilt rule tags](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/prebuilt-rule-components.md#prebuilt-rule-tags).

## Field update statuses [rule-field-update-statuses]

With an Enterprise subscription on {{stack}} or a Security Analytics Complete project on {{serverless-short}}, you can [edit prebuilt rules directly](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/customize-prebuilt-rules.md#edit-prebuilt-rules). When you update a rule you've customized, each field displays a status indicating whether conflicts exist between your changes and the incoming Elastic update:

| Status | Description | Action required |
|---|---|---|
| Ready for update | No conflicts. The field can be updated. | None |
| No update | The field isn't being updated by Elastic, but your current value differs from the original. | None. You can still edit the final value if needed. |
| Review required | Elastic auto-resolved a conflict between your changes and the Elastic update. | Review the suggested resolution and accept or edit it. |
| Action required | Elastic couldn't auto-resolve the conflict. | Manually set the field's final value. |


## Resolve update conflicts [resolve-reduce-rule-conflicts]

When you [edit prebuilt rules directly](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/customize-prebuilt-rules.md#edit-prebuilt-rules) (available with an Enterprise subscription on {{stack}} or a Security Analytics Complete project on {{serverless-short}}), conflicts can arise if Elastic updates the same fields you modified. Keeping prebuilt rules up to date helps minimize the frequency and complexity of these conflicts.

### Auto-resolved conflicts

When {{elastic-sec}} can suggest a resolution, the field displays `Review required`. You can still update rules with auto-resolved conflicts, but review each rule individually rather than bulk-updating to avoid unintended changes.

### Unresolved conflicts

When {{elastic-sec}} can't resolve a conflict, the field displays `Action required`. To fix unresolved conflicts:

1. From the **Rule Updates** tab, select the rule name or select **Review** to open the rule update flyout.

    ::::{tip}
    Fields with unresolved conflicts have the `Action required` status.
    ::::

2. Go to the **Final update** section and do any of the following:

    * Keep your current value instead of accepting the Elastic update.
    * Accept the Elastic update and overwrite your current value.
    * Combine your changes with the Elastic update.

3. Select **Save and accept** to apply your changes. The field's status changes to `Ready for update`.

After resolving all conflicts, select **Update rule** to apply the update.
