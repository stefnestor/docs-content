# Manage detection rules [security-rules-ui-management]

After you [install prebuilt rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/install-prebuilt-rules.md) or [create custom rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/author-rules.md), use the **Rules** page to manage them. The **Rules** page is your central hub for viewing rule status, editing configurations, controlling rule execution, and performing bulk operations. To perform these tasks, you need the [appropriate privileges](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/turn-on-detections.md). To open the **Rules** page, find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the global search field.

:::{agent-skill}
:url: https://github.com/elastic/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/security/detection-rule-management
:::

::::{note}
The **Rules** page was renamed to **Detection rules (SIEM)** in versions 9.3.1, 9.2.6, and 8.19.12.
::::

The following sections explain how to filter rules, edit settings, control execution, export and import rules, and perform bulk operations.

::::{important}

Rules run in the background using the privileges of the user who last edited them. When you create or modify a rule, {{elastic-sec}} generates an [API key](/deploy-manage/api-keys/elasticsearch-api-keys.md) that captures a snapshot of your current privileges. If a user without the required privileges (such as index read access) updates a rule, the rule can stop functioning correctly and no longer generate alerts. To fix this, a user with the right privileges needs to either modify the rule or update the API key. To learn more, refer to [](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/detection-rule-concepts.md#rule-authorization-concept).

::::


## Sort and filter the rules list [sort-filter-rules]

To sort the rules list, click any column header. To sort in descending order, click the column header again.

To filter the rules list, enter a search term in the search bar and press **Return**. You can search by:

* **Rule name**: Partial matches work. Enter any word or phrase from a rule's name.
* **Index pattern**: Exact match required. Enter the full pattern (for example, `filebeat-*` works, but `filebeat` does not).
* **MITRE ATT&CK tactic or technique**: Exact, case-sensitive match required. Enter the full tactic name (`Defense Evasion`) or technique number (`TA0005`). Partial matches like `Defense` or `defense evasion` do not work.


You can also filter the rules list by selecting the **Tags**, **Last response**, **Elastic rules**, **Custom rules**, **Enabled rules**, and **Disabled rules** filters next to the search bar.

The rules list retains your sorting and filtering settings when you navigate away and return to the page. These settings are also preserved when you copy the page’s URL and paste into another browser. Select **Clear filters** above the table to revert to the default view.


## Edit rule settings [edit-rules-settings]

Edit rule settings to modify detection logic, notifications, schedules, and other rule configurations. You can edit a single rule or use bulk actions to update multiple rules at once.

:::{admonition} Subscription requirements
* **Custom rules**: You can edit and bulk-modify custom rules with any {{stack}} subscription or {{serverless-short}} project tier. 
* **Prebuilt rules**: You can edit [rule actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-notifications) with any subscription or project tier. Editing all other prebuilt rule settings (except **Author** and **License**) or bulk-modifying prebuilt rules requires an Enterprise subscription or Security Analytics Complete project.
:::

### Edit a single rule [edit-single-rule]

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Do one of the following:
    * In the Rules table, select the **All actions** menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal` on a rule, then select **Edit rule settings**.
    * Click on a rule's name to open its details page, then click **Edit rule settings**.
3. The **Edit rule settings** view opens, where you can modify the [rule's settings](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/using-the-rule-ui.md). To [snooze](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md#snooze-rule-actions) rule actions, go to the **Actions** tab and click the bell icon {icon}`bell`.
4. Click **Save changes**.

:::{note}
:applies_to: {"stack": "ga 9.4", "serverless": "ga"}
From the rule details page or the **Edit rule settings** view, you can use **Add to chat** to pass the rule to an AI Agent for analysis and suggestions. Refer to [Create and refine detection rules in Agent Builder](/solutions/security/ai/agent-builder/agent-builder.md#create-and-refine-detection-rules-in-agent-builder).
:::

### Bulk edit rule settings [bulk-edit-rules]

Use bulk editing to update settings on multiple rules simultaneously. Rules that can't be modified are automatically skipped, for example, if you try to apply a tag to rules that already have that tag, or apply an index pattern to rules that use data views.

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, select the rules you want to edit.
3. From the **Bulk actions** menu, select one of the following:

    * **Index patterns**: Add or delete the index patterns used by all selected rules.
    * **Tags**: Add or delete tags on all selected rules.
    * **Custom highlighted fields**: Add custom highlighted fields on all selected rules. You can choose any fields that are available in the [default {{elastic-sec}} indices](/solutions/security/get-started/configure-advanced-settings.md#update-sec-indices), or enter field names from other indices. To overwrite a rule's current set of custom highlighted fields, select the **Overwrite all selected rules' custom highlighted fields** option, then click **Save**.
    * **Add rule actions**: Add [rule actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-notifications) on all selected rules. If you add multiple rule actions, you can specify an action frequency for each of them. To overwrite the frequency of existing rule actions, select the option to **Overwrite all selected rules actions**. Keep in mind that rule actions won't run during a [maintenance window](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/maintenance-windows.md) or while the rule is [snoozed](#snooze-rule-actions); they'll resume after the maintenance window or snooze period ends.
    * **Update rule schedules**: Update the [schedules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-schedule) and look-back times on all selected rules.
    * **Apply Timeline template**: Apply a specified [Timeline template](/solutions/security/investigate/timeline-templates.md) to the selected rules. You can also choose **None** to remove Timeline templates from the selected rules.

4. On the page or flyout that opens, update the rule settings.
5. If available, select **Overwrite all selected _x_** to overwrite the settings on the rules. For example, if you're adding tags to multiple rules, selecting **Overwrite all selected rules tags** removes all the rules' original tags and replaces them with the tags you specify.
6. Click **Save**.

## Enable and disable rules [enable-disable-rules]

Enable rules to activate them so they run on their defined schedules and generate alerts. Disable rules to stop them from running without deleting them.

### Enable or disable a single rule

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, do one of the following:
    * Switch the rule's **Enabled** toggle on or off.
    * Select the **All actions** menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal` on a rule, then select **Enable** or **Disable**.
    * Click on a rule's name to open its details page, then select **All actions** > **Enable** or **Disable**.

### Bulk enable or disable rules

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, select the rules you want to enable or disable.
3. From the **Bulk actions** menu, select **Enable** or **Disable**.


## Duplicate rules [duplicate-rules]

Duplicate rules to create copies that you can modify independently. This is useful for creating variations of existing rules or testing changes without affecting the original rule.

### Duplicate a single rule

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Do one of the following:
    * In the Rules table, select the **All actions** menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal` on a rule, then select **Duplicate**.
    * Click on a rule's name to open its details page, then select **All actions** > **Duplicate**.
3. If the rule has exceptions, choose how to handle them:
    * Duplicate the rule and its exceptions (active and expired)
    * Duplicate the rule and active exceptions only
    * Duplicate only the rule

::::{note}
If you duplicate the rule and its exceptions, copies of the exceptions are created and added to the duplicated rule's [default rule list](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-exceptions.md). If the original rule used exceptions from a shared exception list, the duplicated rule will reference the same shared exception list.
::::

### Bulk duplicate rules

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, select the rules you want to duplicate.
3. From the **Bulk actions** menu, select **Duplicate**.
4. If any selected rules have exceptions, choose how to handle them.


## Delete rules [delete-rules]

Delete rules to permanently remove them from your system. This action cannot be undone.

### Delete a single rule

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Do one of the following:
    * In the Rules table, select the **All actions** menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal` on a rule, then select **Delete**.
    * Click on a rule's name to open its details page, then select **All actions** > **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

### Bulk delete rules

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, select the rules you want to delete.
3. From the **Bulk actions** menu, select **Delete**.
4. Confirm the deletion.

## Snooze rule actions [snooze-rule-actions]

Snoozing pauses a rule's actions, such as notifications, ticket creation, and other integrations, without stopping the rule itself. The rule keeps running on schedule and continues generating alerts, but notifications are suppressed until the snooze period ends.

Use snoozing for planned maintenance windows, expected alert spikes, or any time you want to silence notifications temporarily while still capturing alerts for later review.

You can snooze rule actions from the **Installed Rules** tab, the rule details page, or the **Actions** tab when editing a rule. Snooze options include temporary periods, indefinite snoozing, and recurring schedules.

:::

## Run rules manually [manually-run-rules]

Manually run enabled rules for a specified time period to deliberately test them, provide additional rule coverage, or fill gaps in rule executions.

::::{important}
Before manually running rules, make sure you properly understand and plan for rule dependencies. Incorrect scheduling can lead to inconsistent rule results.
::::

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. In the Rules table, do one of the following:

    * Select the **All actions** menu {icon}`boxes_horizontal` on a rule, then select **Manual run**.
    * Select all the rules you want to manually run, select the **Bulk actions** menu, then select **Manual run**.

3. Specify when the manual run starts and ends. The default selection is the current day starting three hours in the past. The rule searches for events during the selected time range.
4. Select **Run** to manually run the rule.

The rule runs over the time range that you selected. All [rule actions](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-notifications) are also activated, except for **Summary of alerts** actions that run at a custom frequency.

::::{note}
Be mindful of the following:

* Any changes that you make to the manual run or rule settings display in the Manual runs table after the current run completes.
* Except for threshold rules, duplicate alerts aren't created if you manually run a rule during a time range that was already covered by a scheduled run.
* Manually running a custom query rule with suppression may incorrectly inflate the number of suppressed alerts.

::::

### Manual runs table [manual-runs-table]

Each manual run can produce multiple rule executions, depending on the time range of the run and the rule's execution schedule.

::::{note}
Manual runs are executed with low priority and limited concurrency, meaning they might take longer to complete. This can be especially apparent for rules requiring multiple executions.
::::

The Manual runs table (found on a rule's **Execution results** tab) tracks manual rule executions and provides important details such as:

* The total number of rule executions that the manual run will produce and how many are failing, pending, running, and completed.
* When the manual run started and the time range that it will cover.

    ::::{note}
    To stop an active run, go to the appropriate row in the table and select **Stop run** in the **Actions** column. Completed rule executions for each manual run are logged in the Execution log table.
    ::::

* The status of each manual run:

    * `Pending`: The rule is not yet running.
    * `Running`: The rule is executing during the time range you specified. Some rule types, such as indicator match rules, can take longer to run.
    * `Error`: The rule's configuration is preventing it from running correctly. For example, the rule's conditions cannot be validated.

## Export and import rules [import-export-rules-ui]

::::{admonition} Requirements
* You can export and import custom rules and prebuilt rules (modified and unmodified) with any {{stack}} subscription or {{serverless-short}} project feature tier.
* At minimum, your role needs `Read` privileges for the **Action and Connectors** feature to import rules with actions. To overwrite or add new connectors, you need `All` privileges. Refer to [Turn on detections](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/turn-on-detections.md) to learn more about the required privileges for managing rules.
::::

You can export custom detection rules to an `.ndjson` file, which you can then import into another {{elastic-sec}} environment.

The `.ndjson` file also includes any actions, connectors, and exception lists related to the exported rules. However, other configuration items require additional handling when exporting and importing rules:

* **Data views**: For rules that use a {{kib}} data view as a data source, the exported file contains the associated `data_view_id`, but does *not* include any other data view configuration. To export/import between {{kib}} spaces, first use the [Saved Objects](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/saved-objects.md#managing-saved-objects-share-to-space) UI to share the data view with the destination space.

    To import into a different {{stack}} deployment, the destination cluster must include a data view with a matching data view ID (configured in the [data view’s advanced settings](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/data-views.md)). Alternatively, after importing, you can manually reconfigure the rule to use an appropriate data view in the destination system.

* **Actions and connectors**: Rule actions and connectors are included in the exported file, but sensitive information about the connector (such as authentication credentials) *is not* included. You must re-add missing connector details after importing detection rules.

    ::::{tip}
    You can also use the [Saved Objects](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/saved-objects.md#saved-objects-export) UI to export and import necessary connectors before importing detection rules.
    ::::

* **Value lists**: Any value lists used for rule exceptions are *not* included in rule exports or imports. Use the [Manage value lists](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-manage-value-lists.md#edit-value-lists) UI to export and import value lists separately.

### Export rules [export-rules-ui]

1. Find **Detection rules (SIEM)** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Do one of the following:

    * Export a single rule: Find the rule in the Rules table, then select **All actions** > **Export**. Alternatively, export the rule from its details page (click on the rule name to open its details, then click **All actions** > **Export**).
    * Export multiple rules: In the Rules table, select the rules you want to export, then click **Bulk actions > Export**.

The rules are exported to an `.ndjson` file.

### Import rules [import-rules-ui]

1. Above the Rules table, click **Import rules**.
2. In the Import rules modal:

    1. Drag and drop the `.ndjson` file that contains the exported rules.
    2. (Optional) Select the appropriate options to overwrite existing data:

        * **Overwrite existing detection rules with conflicting "rule_id"**: Updates existing rules if they match the `rule_id` value of any rules in the import file. Configuration data included with the rules, such as actions, is also overwritten.
        * **Overwrite existing exception lists with conflicting "list_id"**: Replaces existing exception lists with exception lists from the import file if they have a matching `list_id` value.
        * **Overwrite existing connectors with conflicting action "id"**: Updates existing connectors if they match the `action id` value of any rule actions in the import file. Configuration data included with the actions is also overwritten.

The imported rules are added to the Rules table.

## Handle deprecated prebuilt rules [deprecated-prebuilt-rules]
```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4+
```

When a prebuilt rule that you installed is deprecated, it is no longer maintained as part of Elastic’s prebuilt rule library. Deprecated rules do not receive new updates or fixes from Elastic. If you want to keep the same detection logic and maintain it yourself, duplicate the rule as a custom rule before you remove the deprecated prebuilt installation.

{{elastic-sec}} surfaces deprecated prebuilt rules in the UI so you can find them and respond. If any are installed, a dismissible callout on the **Installed Rules** tab alerts you. On a rule’s details page, a callout also marks deprecated prebuilt rules and includes a deprecation reason if the package provides one. From that page you can choose to delete the deprecated prebuilt rule, or [create a duplicate](#duplicate-rules) as a custom rule before deleting the original prebuilt rule. That way you keep the same detection logic and can maintain it as a custom rule.

:::{tip}
Staying current with Elastic’s prebuilt rule updates helps you get the latest detection logic and fixes while rules are still supported. Refer to [Update Elastic prebuilt rules](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/update-prebuilt-rules.md) for more details.
