You can use {{elastic-sec}}'s built-in AI tools to speed up your work and augment your team’s capabilities. The pages in this section describe [AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md), which answers questions and enhances your workflows throughout {{elastic-sec}}, and [Attack discovery](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery.md), which speeds up the triage process by finding patterns and identifying attacks spanning multiple alerts.
