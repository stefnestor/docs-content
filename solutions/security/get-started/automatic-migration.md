# Automatic migration

Automatic Migration helps you quickly migrate Splunk and QRadar assets to {{elastic-sec}}. The following asset types are supported:

* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+, preview 9.2-9.3` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Splunk Classic dashboards (v1.1)
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Splunk Dashboard Studio dashboards
* {applies_to}`stack: preview =9.0, ga 9.1+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` Splunk rules
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+, preview 9.3` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` QRadar rules

The following table summarizes which assets Automatic Migration can and cannot translate:

| Source platform | Asset type | Supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk | Rules (saved searches) | Yes |
| Splunk | Classic dashboards (v1.1) | Yes |
| Splunk | Dashboard Studio dashboards | Yes |
| QRadar | Rules | Yes |
| QRadar | Dashboards | No |

For rule migrations, if comparable Elastic-authored rules exist, Automatic Migration simplifies onboarding by mapping your rules to them. Otherwise, it creates custom rules and dashboards on the fly so you can verify and edit them instead of writing them from scratch.

You can ingest your data before migrating your assets, or migrate your assets first in which case the tool recommends which data sources you need to power your migrated rules.

::::{admonition} Splunk dashboard migration limitations
Only supports `visualization`, `chart`, `table`, and `single value (Metric)` Splunk dashboard panels, not `map`, `event`, or `html` panels. You can still migrate a dashboard that contains unsupported panels, but those panels appear as `Unsupported` in migrated dashboards.
::::

## Get started with Automatic Migration

1. Find **Get started** in the navigation menu or use the [global search bar](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Under **Configure AI provider**, select a configured model or [add a new one](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/llm-connectors.md). For information on how different models perform, refer to the [LLM performance matrix](/solutions/security/ai/large-language-model-performance-matrix.md).
3. Next, under **Migrate rules & dashboards**, select either **Translate your existing SIEM rules to Elastic** or **Migrate your existing SIEM dashboards to Elastic**, then click **Upload**. The upload flyout appears. 
4. Select the migration source and follow the instructions on the flyout to export your assets.

   :screenshot:
   :::


   ::::{note}
   The provided queries download a default selection of assets. For QRadar exports, we do not recommend changing the query. For Splunk, as long as you export your results as JSON, you can use a different query. For example, the following custom query would download rules related to just the `splunksysmonsecurity` app:

   ```
   | rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches
   | search is_scheduled=1 AND eai:acl.app=splunksysmonsecurity
   | where disabled=0
   | table id, title, search, description, action.escu.eli5,
   ```

   For rule migration, we recommend against downloading all searches (for example with `| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches`) because much of the data would be irrelevant to asset migration.
   ::::

5. Select your JSON file and click **Upload**. If the file is large, you can separate it into multiple parts and upload them individually to avoid exceeding your LLM's context window.

6. After you upload your assets, Automatic Migration detects whether they use any macros, lookups, reference sets, or MITRE mappings. If so, follow the instructions which appear to export and upload them. Alternatively, you can complete this step later—however, some of your migrated assets will have a `partially translated` status. If you upload them now, you don't have to stay on this page—a notification appears when processing is complete.

7. Click **Translate** to start the rule translation process. The **Start rules migration** popup appears.

8. Use the dropdown menu to select which AI connector to use. For rule migrations, the **Match to Elastic prebuilt rules** option (on by default) converts any migrated rules that are similar to an Elastic prebuilt rule to that prebuilt rule (this uses fewer tokens). When the option is off, each rule is converted into a new custom rule. 

9. Click **Translate**. A name for the migration is automatically created, and you can track its progress on this page. The **More actions** ({icon}`boxes_vertical`) button lets you rename or delete the migration. 

   ::::{image} /solutions/images/security-siem-migration-rule-status-more-actions.png
   :alt: The rule migration status view
   :width: 850px
   :screenshot:
   ::::

   You don't need to stay on this page. A notification appears when the migration is complete.


10. Use the **Add SIEM data with Integrations** section to set up data ingestion from third-party sources. If at least one rules migration has completed, the **Recommended** tab shows integrations that provide the data needed by your translated rules. These include both Elastic-managed integrations and any applicable custom integrations you made using [automatic import](/explore-analyze/ai-features/automatic-import.md).

   :screenshot:
   ::::

11. When migration is complete, click the notification or return to the **Get started** page then click **View translated rules** or **View translated dashboards** to open the [**Translated rules**](#the-translated-rules-page) page  or the [**Translated dashboards**](#the-translated-dashboards-page) page. 


## The Translated rules page

This section describes the **Translated rules** page's interface and the data it displays. Use the **Migrations** dropdown menu in the upper right to select which migration appears. 

::::{image} /solutions/images/security-siem-migration-processed-rules.png
:alt: The translated rules page
:width: 850px
:screenshot:
::::

The table's fields are as follows:

* **Updated:** The migration date.
* **Name:** The names of Elastic-authored rules cannot be edited until after rule installation. To edit the name of a custom translated rule, click the name and select **Edit**.
* **Status:** The rule's translation status:
  * `Installed`: Already added to Elastic SIEM. Click **View** to manage and enable it.
  * `Translated`: Ready to install. This rule was mapped to an Elastic-authored rule, or translated by Automatic Import. Click **Install** to install it.
  * `Partially translated`: Part of the query could not be translated. You may need to specify an index pattern for the rule query, upload missing macros or lookups, or fix broken rule syntax. 
    ::::{note}
    To fix partially translated rules that are missing an index pattern, use the **Update missing index pattern** button. This affects all migrated assets that contain the placeholder `[indexPattern]`, not just those currently visibly on the table page.
    ::::
  * `Not translated`: None of the original query could be translated.
  * `Failed`: Translation failed. Refer to the the error for details.
* **Risk Score:** For Elastic-authored rules, risk scores are predefined. For custom translated rules, risk scores are defined as follows:
  * If the source rule has a field comparable to Elastic's `risk score`, we use that value.
  * Otherwise, if the source rule has a field comparable to Elastic's `rule severity` field, we base the risk score on that value according to [these guidelines](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/common-rule-settings.md#rule-ui-basic-params).
  * If neither of the above apply, we assign a default value.
* **Rule severity:** For Elastic-authored rules, severity scores are predefined. For custom translated rules, risk scores are based on the source rule's severity field. Splunk severity scores are translated to Elastic rule severity scores as follows:

  | Splunk severity | Elastic rule severity |
  | ------- | ----------- |
  | 1 (Info)     | Low      |
  | 2 (Low)      | Low      |
  | 3 (Medium)   | Medium   |
  | 4 (High)     | High     |
  | 5 (Critical) | Critical |

* **Author:** Shows one of two possible values: `Elastic`, or `Custom`. Elastic-authored rules are created by Elastic and update automatically. Custom rules are translated by the Automatic Migration tool or your team, and do not update automatically.
* **Integrations:** Shows the number of Elastic integrations that must be installed to provide data for the rule to run successfully.
* **Actions:** 
  * To add a rule to Elastic, select one or more `translated` rules then click **Install**. Then select them again and click **Enable**.
  * To reprocess a rule using the same or a different LLM connector, select one or more rules that weren't successfully translated then click **Reprocess**. A menu appears where you can select which AI connector to use.

### Finalize translated rules and view rule details

To install any rules that were partially translated or not translated, you must first edit them. Optionally, you can also edit rules that were successfully translated to finetune them.

:::{note}
You cannot edit Elastic-authored rules using this interface, but after they are installed you can [edit them](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md) from the **Rules** page.
:::

Click a rule's name to open its details flyout to the **Translation** tab, which shows the source rule alongside the translated — or partially translated — Elastic version. You can update any part of the rule. When finished, click **Save**.

::::{image} /solutions/images/security-siem-migration-edit-rule.png
:alt: The rule details flyout
:width: 850px
:screenshot:
::::

::::{note}
If you haven't yet ingested your data, you may encounter `Unknown index` or `Unknown column` errors. You can ignore these and add your data later.
::::

The rule details flyout has two other tabs, **Overview** and **Summary**. The **Overview** tab displays information such as the rule's severity, risk score, rule type, and how frequently it runs. The **Summary** tab explains the logic behind how the rule was translated, such as why specific {{esql}} commands were used, or why a source rule was mapped to a particular Elastic-authored rule.

## The Translated dashboards page 

This section describes the **Translated dashboards** page's interface and the data it displays. Use the **Migrations** dropdown menu in the upper right to select which migration appears. 

::::{image} /solutions/images/security-siem-migration-processed-dashboards.png
:alt: The translated rules page
:width: 850px
:screenshot:
::::

:::::{admonition} Important information for QRadar "BB" rules

- {applies_to}`stack: preview =9.3`
QRadar Building Block rules can appear in QRadar migrations. You can identify them by their `BB:` prefix. You should not enable these rules, because they will generate noisy alerts. If you do enable them, we recommend you delete them.

- {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+`
Building block rule logic is included automatically in translated rules. No action is required.

:::::

The table's fields are as follows:

* **Name:** The names of the translated dashboards cannot be edited until after installation. 
* **Updated:** The date when the dashboard was last modified in its source platform.
* **Status:** The dashboard's translation status:
  * `Installed`: Already added to {{elastic-sec}}. Click **View** to manage it.
  * `Translated`: Ready to install. Click **Install** to install it.
  * `Partially translated`: Part of the dashboard could not be translated. Upload any missing macros or lookups, or fix broken syntax. 
  * `Not translated`: None of the original dashboard could be translated.
  * `Failed`: Translation failed. Click the dashboard's name to open the details flyout and view error details.
* **Tags:** The dashboard's tags, which identify its source application, and can be used to identify it on the **Dashboards** page.
* **Actions:** To view an `Installed` dashboard, click **View**. To install a `Translated` dashboard, click **Install**. To reprocess a `Failed` dashboard, click **Reprocess**.

### View dashboard migration details
For an explanation of a dashboard's translation, click its name to open the dashboard details flyout and view an AI chat that explains the reasoning behind each panel's translation. 


### Finalize translated dashboards

Once you're on the **Translated dashboards** page, to install any assets that were partially translated, you need to edit them. Optionally, you can also edit assets that were successfully translated to finetune them. For more information about editing dashboards, refer to [Building dashboards](/explore-analyze/dashboards/building.md).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**How does Automatic Migration handle assets that can't be exactly translated for various reasons, such as feature parity issues?**

After translation, assets that can't be translated appear with a status of either partially translated (yellow) or not translated (red). From there, you can address them individually.

**Are nested macros supported?**

Yes, Automatic Migration can handle nested macros.

**How can we ensure rules stay up to date?**

With the exception of rules that were matched to Elastic-authored rules (which are updated automatically), assets created by Automatic Migration must be maintained by you.

**What index does information about each migration appear in?**

Rule migration data appears in `.kibana-siem-rule-migrations-rules-default`. Dashboard migration data appears in `.kibana-siem-dashboard-migrations-dashboards-default`. You can use [Discover](/explore-analyze/discover.md) to review a variety of metrics, analyze metrics, and more.

**How does Automatic Migration handle Splunk assets which lookup other indices?**

Assets that fall into this category will typically appear with a status of partially translated. You can use the [`LOOKUP JOIN`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-lookup-join.md) capability to help in this situation.
