# Evaluate Elastic during a trial

To make the most of your free 14-day {{ecloud}} trial, set up high-value use cases, explore the most powerful Elastic features, and gather the evidence you need to determine whether Elastic is the right choice for your organization.

Ingest real data and validate the capabilities that will save you time, reduce costs, and prevent operational challenges in production.

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to structure your trial, make strategic Elastic product decisions, and measure success so you can build a meaningful proof of concept (PoC).

For a quick intro, start by learning more about [{{ecloud}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud.md).

## What is included in your trial

Your {{ecloud}} trial gives you full access to explore the following features and capabilities:

- All features available in the [Search](/solutions/search.md), [{{observability}}](/solutions/observability.md), and [Security](/solutions/security.md) solutions, depending on your choice of deployment and project type.
- Access to the following: 
  - Integrations to ingest your data using the simplest method that meets your use case.
  - {{ml-cap}} features to evaluate anomaly detection results, search relevance, and explore visualization tools from our trained models.
  - Advanced analytics to test {{es}} as a vector database for building modern GenAI and semantic search applications.

:::{tip}
If you prefer to set up {{es}} and {{kib}} in Docker for local development or testing, refer to [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/local-development-installation-quickstart.md). By default, new installations have a Basic license that never expires. To explore all the available solutions and features, start a 30-day free trial by following the instructions in [](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-self-managed-cluster.md).

## Before you begin

A successful trial starts with clarity about what you want to achieve. Three foundational decisions shape your trial: defining your trial goal, identifying your primary use case, and choosing the deployment type that best supports it.

### Define your trial goal

To achieve the best results, clarify what success looks like for your trial.

Consider the following questions:

- **What is the main problem you're trying to solve?** Examples: slow root-cause analysis, rising infrastructure costs, missing search relevance, or too many disconnected data sources.
- **If you choose to move forward, which team will use Elastic?**
- **What would a successful PoC show?** Faster investigations? Better visibility? Reduced spend?
- **Have you identified the KPIs or metrics that matter most?** Examples: time to detect, ingestion speed, relevance scores, or dashboard load times.

Document your trial goal now. This clarity will guide your use case selection and help you measure success at the end of your trial.

### Identify your primary use case

With your trial goal in mind, identify which Elastic solution best addresses your challenge. Elastic can support many workloads, but a focused trial generates more precise results. You can always expand to additional use cases after establishing initial success.

| Your challenge | Primary use case |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Users struggle to find relevant information across systems | [Search](/solutions/search.md) |
| Build your first search application | [Search](/solutions/search.md) |
| Limited visibility into application performance or system health | [Observability](/solutions/observability.md) |
| Slow incident response and troubleshooting | [Observability](/solutions/observability.md) |
| Identify unknown unknowns through logs, traces, and metrics | [Observability](/solutions/observability.md) |
| Detect and respond to endpoint security threats | [Security](/solutions/security.md) |
| Security logs are difficult to analyze or correlate | [Security](/solutions/security.md) |
| Compliance requires centralized security monitoring | [Security](/solutions/security.md) |

### Choose your deployment type

Once you know what you want to evaluate, choose the deployment option that best supports your goals. Elastic offers two primary deployment options on {{ecloud}}.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} {{serverless-full}}

- Fully managed with automatic scaling.
- Simplified configuration and maintenance.
- Project-based organization (Search, {{observability}}, or Security).
- Ideal for fast setup and focused trials of a single use case.

:::

:::{tab-item} {{ech}}

- Access to all solutions in a single deployment.
- More control over cluster configuration and sizing.
- Traditional {{es}} architecture.
- Best for evaluating multiple use cases together or when you need specific configuration options.

:::

::::

:::{tip}
For most trials, {{serverless-short}} provides the fastest path to demonstrating value. You can always explore hosted options later or migrate to production with different requirements.
:::

For detailed comparisons, refer to:

- [Deployment comparison](/deploy-manage/deploy/deployment-comparison.md): Side-by-side feature and capability comparison.
- [Differences from other {{es}} offerings](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/differences-from-other-elasticsearch-offerings.md): Understand how {{ecloud}} differs from self-managed deployments.

## Build your proof of concept

With your trial goal defined, follow this framework to build a PoC that demonstrates clear value and helps you make an informed decision about adopting Elastic.

### Example success criteria by use case

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Search

- Reduce time to find information by X%.
- Index and search Y documents with sub-second response times.
- Demonstrate relevance tuning for domain-specific searches.

:::

:::{tab-item} Observability

- Reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) incidents by X minutes.
- Gain visibility into application performance across Y services.
- Centralize logs from Z disparate systems.

:::

:::{tab-item} Security

- Detect X types of threats that current tools miss.
- Reduce investigation time by Y%.
- Demonstrate compliance reporting for Z requirements.

:::

::::

### Ingest real data

To build a meaningful PoC, you need real-world data and not just sample datasets.

#### Why real data matters

- Results are more trustworthy for stakeholders.
- Dashboards and alerts reflect real use cases.
- Search and relevance testing becomes meaningful.
- Performance benchmarks are accurate.

#### Recommended ingestion methods

- [Elastic Agent](/reference/fleet/index.md) for logs, metrics, traces, and security data
- [Beats](beats://reference/index.md) or [Logstash](logstash://reference/index.md) for existing pipelines
- [Ingest pipelines](/manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md) for transformations and enrichment
- Elasticsearch APIs for custom application ingestion

Start with a minimal dataset if needed, then expand.

### Explore key Elastic features

Once data is flowing, use the trial to validate the features that will determine long-term adoption. Take notes on what works well and where follow-up questions might be needed.
