# Create a dashboard [create-dashboard]

Create a new dashboard in {{product.kibana}} to start visualizing and monitoring your data. Once created, you can add visualizations, configure interactive controls, and organize panels to build a comprehensive view of your data that meets your specific monitoring and analysis needs.

## Requirements [create-dashboard-requirements]

Before creating a dashboard, ensure you have:

* [Data indexed into {{product.elasticsearch}}](/manage-data/ingest.md) and at least one [data view](../find-and-organize/data-views.md) configured
* **All** privilege for the **Dashboard** feature in {{product.kibana}}

## Create a new dashboard [create-dashboard-steps]

1. Open the **Dashboards** page in {{product.kibana}}.
2. Select **Create dashboard** to start with an empty dashboard.

    When you create a dashboard, you are automatically in edit mode and can make changes to the dashboard.

3. Populate your dashboard with the content that you need. You can:

    * [**Add new visualizations**](../visualize.md#panels-editors). Create a chart using [Lens](../visualize/lens.md), the default visualization editor in {{product.kibana}}, or other visualizations such as [Maps](../visualize/maps.md).
    * [**Add existing content from the library**](../visualize/visualize-library.md). Select existing visualizations or Discover sessions that have already been configured and saved to the **Visualize Library**.
    * [**Add annotations or navigation panels**](../visualize.md#panels-editors). Make your dashboard more informative and easier to read with sections, text, and images.
    * [**Add controls**](add-controls.md). Define a set of interactive filters (options lists, range or time sliders) that you and future users of this dashboard can use to explore its data.

4. Organize your dashboard by [organizing the various panels](arrange-panels.md).
5. Define the main settings of your dashboard from the **Settings** menu located in the toolbar.

    1. A meaningful title, description, and [tags](../find-and-organize/tags.md) allow you to find the dashboard quickly later when browsing your list of dashboards or using the {{kib}} search bar.
    2. Additional display options allow you unify the look and feel of the dashboard’s panels:

        * **Store time with dashboard** — Saves the specified time filter.
        * **Use margins between panels** — Adds a margin of space between each panel.
        * **Show panel titles** — Displays the titles in the panel headers.
        * **Sync color palettes across panels** — Applies the same color palette to all panels on the dashboard.
        * **Sync cursor across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a time series chart or a heatmap, the cursor on all other related dashboard charts automatically appears.
        * **Sync tooltips across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a **Lens** chart, the tooltips on all other related dashboard charts automatically appear.

    3. Click **Apply**.

6. Click **Save**  to save the dashboard.
