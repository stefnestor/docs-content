# Create a dashboard [create-dashboard]

Create a new dashboard in {{product.kibana}} to start visualizing and monitoring your data. Once created, you can add visualizations, configure interactive controls, and organize panels to build a comprehensive view of your data that meets your specific monitoring and analysis needs.

## Requirements [create-dashboard-requirements]

Before creating a dashboard, ensure you have:

* [Data indexed into {{product.elasticsearch}}](/manage-data/ingest.md) and at least one [data view](../find-and-organize/data-views.md) configured
* **All** privilege for the **Dashboard** feature in {{product.kibana}}

## Create a new dashboard [create-dashboard-steps]

1. Open the **Dashboards** page in {{product.kibana}}.
2. Select **Create dashboard** to start with an empty dashboard.

    When you create a dashboard, you are automatically in edit mode and can make changes to the dashboard.

3. Populate your dashboard with the content that you need. You can:

    * [**Add new visualizations**](../visualize.md#panels-editors). Create a chart using [Lens](../visualize/lens.md), the default visualization editor in {{product.kibana}}, or other visualizations such as [Maps](../visualize/maps.md).
    * [**Add existing content from the library**](../visualize/visualize-library.md). Select existing visualizations or Discover sessions that have already been configured and saved to the **Visualize Library**.
    * [**Add annotations or navigation panels**](../visualize.md#panels-editors). Make your dashboard more informative and easier to read with sections, text, and images.
    * [**Add controls**](add-controls.md). Define a set of interactive filters (options lists, range or time sliders) that you and future users of this dashboard can use to explore its data.

4. Organize your dashboard by [organizing the various panels](arrange-panels.md).
5. Define the main settings of your dashboard from the **Settings** menu in the application menu.

    1. A meaningful title, description, and [tags](../find-and-organize/tags.md) allow you to find the dashboard quickly later when browsing your list of dashboards or using the {{kib}} search bar.
    2. Additional display options allow you unify the look and feel of the dashboard’s panels:

        * **Store time with dashboard** — Saves the specified time filter.
        * **Use margins between panels** — Adds a margin of space between each panel.
        * **Show panel titles** — Displays the titles in the panel headers.
        * {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` **Show panel borders** — Displays a border around each panel. Turn off for a cleaner look. Individual panels can override this setting from their own settings.
        * **Sync color palettes across panels** — Applies the same color palette to all panels on the dashboard.
        * **Sync cursor across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a time series chart or a heatmap, the cursor on all other related dashboard charts automatically appears.
        * **Sync tooltips across panels** — When you hover your cursor over a **Lens** chart, the tooltips on all other related dashboard charts automatically appear.
        * {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: unavailable` **Store CPS scope with dashboard** — Saves the current [{{cps}} scope](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-manage-scope.md#cps-in-kibana) with the dashboard so it restores automatically when anyone opens it.

    3. Click **Apply**.
       


6. Save the dashboard. When saving, you can configure the following options:

    - **Title** and **Description**: Give the dashboard a meaningful name and description so you and others can find it later.
    - **Tags**: Add [tags](../find-and-organize/tags.md) to organize and categorize the dashboard.
    - **Store time with dashboard**: Saves the current time filter with the dashboard.
    - {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: unavailable` **Store CPS scope with dashboard**: Saves the current [{{cps}} scope](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-manage-scope.md#cps-in-kibana) with the dashboard so it restores automatically when opened. When this option is not active, the dashboard opens with the {{cps-init}} scope currently active for the session.
    - {applies_to}`serverless:` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3+` **Permissions**: Control who can access the dashboard. You can share with one of the following permissions:
      - **Can edit**: Everybody in the space can edit, delete, and fully manage the dashboard.
      - **Can view**: Everybody in the space can view the dashboard, but cannot edit or delete it.

## Create a dashboard with {{agent-builder}}

You can also create dashboards through natural language chat with [{{agent-builder}}](/explore-analyze/ai-features/agent-builder/chat.md) agents. Describe what you want to visualize and the agent builds a dashboard with {{esql}}-powered visualization panels. You can iterate on the dashboard in conversation before saving it. To learn more, refer to [Dashboards and visualizations in chat](/explore-analyze/ai-features/agent-builder/agent-builder-dashboards-and-visualizations.md).
