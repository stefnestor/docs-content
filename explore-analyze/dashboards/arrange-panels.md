# Organize dashboard panels [arrange-panels]

## Move and resize panels [resizing-containers]

Compare the data in your panels side-by-side, organize panels by priority, resize the panels so they all appear immediately on the dashboard, and more.

In the toolbar, click **Edit**, then use the following options:

* To move, hover over the panel, click and hold ![The move control icon](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-move-control.png "The move control icon =4%x4%") and drag to the new location. Your screen scrolls automatically when you drag above or below the visible parts of the dashboard.
* To resize, click and hold the bottom right corner of the panel and drag to the new dimensions.
* To maximize to full screen, open the panel menu and click **Maximize**.

  ::::{tip}
  If you [share](sharing.md) a dashboard while viewing a full screen panel, the generated link will directly open the same panel in full screen mode.

## Copy and duplicate panels [duplicate-panels]

To duplicate a panel and the configured functionality, use the clone and copy panel options. Cloned and copied panels replicate all of the functionality from the original panel, including renaming, editing, and cloning.

Duplicated panels appear next to the original panel, and move the other panels to provide a space on the dashboard.

1. In the toolbar, click **Edit**.
2. Open the panel menu and select **Duplicate**.


#### Copy panels [copy-to-dashboard]

Copy panels from one dashboard to another dashboard.

1. Open the panel menu and select **Copy to dashboard**.
2. On the **Copy to dashboard** window, select the dashboard, then click **Copy and go to dashboard**.
