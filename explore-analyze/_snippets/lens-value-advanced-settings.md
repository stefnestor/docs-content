:::{dropdown} Advanced settings
Depending on the data you defined, several options allow you to apply additional filtering to the data taken into account to compute the metric's value:
    
- **Normalize by unit**: Normalize the metric values to show per unit of time.
- **Filter by**: Specify a query.
- **Reduced time range**: Reduce the time range specified on the dashboard's time filter by the specified duration.
- **Time shift**: Shift the time range by the specified duration. This is useful if the value should use a different time range than the one selected on the dashboard.
- **Hide zero values**: Don't show values equal to zero. This option is on by default.
