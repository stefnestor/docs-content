You can interact with filter pills to edit them, temporarily alter their behavior without having to remove them, or make them available in other contexts. The following options are available when selecting a filter pill:

**Pin across all apps** and **Unpin**
:    Adds this filter to available dashboards and to apps such as **Discover**, **Lens**, **Maps**, and **Visualize**. You remove the filter if you:
     * Unpin it. In this case, the filter only remains on the currently open app, unpinned.
     * Remove it from any place while it's still pinned.
     * Refresh your session, for example by opening a dashboard in a new tab. Pinned filters are not saved along with the dashboard, visualization, or Discover session that you added them to.

     :::{tip}
     When a pinned filter can't be applied, for example if a field specified in the filter doesn't exist in the current data view, the filter is ignored and shows in a different color.
     :::

**Edit filter**
:    Lets you edit and update the filter.

**Exclude results** and **Include results**
:    Reverses the filter behavior.

**Temporarily disable** and **Re-enable**
:    Lets you temporarily deactivate a filter instead of requiring you to remove it. This is particularly useful for testing different filter combinations.

**Delete**
:    Removes the filter.

You can perform most of these actions at once for all filters in your current view using the **Filter** icon {icon}`filter`. From the menu that opens, select **Apply to all**, then choose the action you'd like to perform.
