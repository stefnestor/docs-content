The request **Inspector** is available in **Discover** and for all **Dashboards** visualization panels that are built from a query. The available information can differ based on the request.

   - If you're in **Discover**:
      - {applies_to}`serverless:` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4` Hover over the active tab and select the {icon}`boxes_vertical` **Actions** icon, then select **Inspect**.
      - {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` Select **Inspect** from the application menu.
   - If you're in **Dashboards**, open the panel menu and select **Inspect**.
1. Open the **View** dropdown, then select **Requests**.
1. Several tabs with different information can appear, depending on nature of the request:
   :::{tip}
   Some visualizations rely on several requests. From the dropdown, select the request you want to inspect. 
   :::
    * **Statistics**: Provides general information and statistics about the request. For example, you can check if the number of hits and query time match your expectations. If not, this can indicate an issue with the request used to build the visualization.
    * **Clusters and shards**: Lists the {{es}} clusters and shards queried to fetch the data, including for [{{ccs}}](/explore-analyze/cross-cluster-search.md) and [{{cps}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search.md) queries. Use this tab to verify that the request ran correctly.

      :::{note}
      This tab is not available for Vega visualizations.
