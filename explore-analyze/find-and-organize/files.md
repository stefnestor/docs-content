# Files [files]

Several features let you upload files. For example, you can add files to [cases](../../solutions/observability/incident-management/cases.md) or upload a logo to an [Image panel](../visualize/image-panels.md) in a dashboard.

You can access and manage all of the files currently stored in {{kib}} from the **Files** page.
