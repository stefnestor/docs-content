# Alert panels

To view alerts in a dashboard, add **Alerts** panels that show selected alerts. Each panel can display either **Observability** or **Security** alerts with the rule tags and rule types that you select. 

## Create an alerts panel

1. Open the panel menu from your dashboard.

    * {applies_to}`serverless:` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2+` Select **Add** in the application menu and, if required, **New panel**.
    * {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1` Select **Add panel** in the application menu.

2. Select **Alerts**. The configuration flyout appears.
3. ({{stack}} deployments only) Under **Solution**, select either **Observability** or **Security** to specify the type of alerts you want to display. 
4. Under **Filter by** select either **Rule tags** or **Rule types**. 
5. (Optional) To use both types of filters, first define one filter, then use the boolean **+ OR** or **+ AND** options that appear to define the second filter.
5. Click **Save**. Your panel appears on the dashboard.

- (**Active** rules only) **Mark as untracked**: Change the alert's status from **Active** to **Untracked**.
- (**Active** rules only) **Snooze**: [Snooze](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/view-alerts.md#snooze-alerts) the alert to stop its actions from running. {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` 
- (**Active** rules only) **Mute**: Mute alerts from the associated rule. {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.4` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable`
- (**Active** rules only) **Mark as acknowledged**: Set the alert to [**acknowledged**](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/view-alerts.md#acknowledge-alerts) {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`

## Edit an alerts panel

To edit an existing alerts panel, hover over the panel. Three buttons appear:

- **Edit** {icon}`pencil`: Update which alerts appear in the panel.
- **Settings** {icon}`gear`: Update the panel's title or description, or add a custom time range.
- **More actions** {icon}`boxes_vertical`: Duplicate, maximize, copy to another dashboard, or remove the panel.
