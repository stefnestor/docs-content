# Search across multiple indices [maps-search-across-multiple-indices]

Your map might contain multiple {{es}} indices. This can occur when your map contains two or more layers with {{es}} sources from different indices. This can also occur with a single layer with an {{es}} source and a [Term join](terms-join.md).

Searching across multiple indices might sometimes result in empty layers. The most common cause for empty layers are searches for a field that exists in one index, but does not exist in other indices.


## Disable global search for a layer [maps-disable-search-for-layer]

One strategy for eliminating unintentional empty layers from a cross index search is to [disable global search for a layer](maps-search.md#maps-narrow-layer-by-global-search).


## Use _index in a search [maps-add-index-search]

Add [_index](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-index-field.md) to your search to include documents from indices that do not contain a search field.

For example, suppose you have a vector layer showing the `kibana_sample_data_logs` documents and another vector layer with `kibana_sample_data_flights` documents. (See [adding sample data](/explore-analyze/index.md) to install the `kibana_sample_data_logs` and `kibana_sample_data_flights` indices.)

If you query for

```
machine.os.keyword : "osx"
```

the `kibana_sample_data_flights` layer is empty because the index `kibana_sample_data_flights` does not contain the field `machine.os.keyword` and no documents match the query.

If you instead query for

```
machine.os.keyword : "osx" or _index : "kibana_sample_data_flights"
```

the `kibana_sample_data_flights` layer includes data.
