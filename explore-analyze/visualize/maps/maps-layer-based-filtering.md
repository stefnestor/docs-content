# Filter a single layer [maps-layer-based-filtering]

You can apply a search request to individual layers by setting `Filters` in the layer details panel. Click the **Add filter** button to add a filter to a layer.

::::{note}
Layer filters are not applied to the right side of **term joins**. You can apply a search request to the right side of **term joins** by setting the **where** clause in the join definition. For example, suppose you have a layer with a term join where the left side is roads and the right side is traffic volume measurements. A layer filter of `roadType is "highway"` is applied to the roads index, but not to the traffic volume measurements index.
