# Point to point [point-to-point]

A point-to-point connection plots aggregated data paths between the source and the destination. Thicker, darker lines symbolize more connections between a source and destination, and thinner, lighter lines symbolize less connections.

Point to point uses an {{es}} [terms aggregation](elasticsearch://reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.md) to group your documents by destination. Then, a nested [GeoTile grid aggregation](elasticsearch://reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation.md) groups sources for each destination into grids. A line connects each source grid centroid to each destination.

Point-to-point layers are used in several common use cases:

* Source-destination maps for network traffic
* Origin-destination maps for flight data
* Origin-destination flows for import/export/migration
* Origin-destination for pick-up/drop-off data
