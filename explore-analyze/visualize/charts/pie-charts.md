# Build pie charts with {{kib}}

Pie charts display parts of a whole as slices, where each slice represents a value and its size represents its prevalence. Pie charts are ideal for illustrating the relative prevalence of categorical data, and for displaying percentage or proportional data. They work best with a **maximum of 6 slices** and when proportions are around 25%, 50%, or 75%, as these are easiest to perceive accurately. For more than 6 categories, precise comparisons, or negative values, consider using [bar charts](bar-charts.md) instead. For comparing similarly-sized proportions or displaying percentages as discrete units, consider using [waffle charts](waffle-charts.md).

You can create pie charts in {{kib}} using [**Lens**](../lens.md).

## Build a pie chart

:::{include} ../../_snippets/lens-prerequisites.md
:::

To build a pie chart:

::::::{stepper}

:::::{step} Access Lens
**Lens** is {{kib}}'s main visualization editor. You can access it:
- From a dashboard: On the **Dashboards** page, open or create the dashboard where you want to add a pie chart, then add a new visualization.
- From the **Visualize library** page by creating a new visualization.
:::::

:::::{step} Set the visualization to Pie
New visualizations often start as **Bar** charts.

Using the **Visualization type** dropdown, select **Pie**.
:::::

:::::{step} Define the data to show
1. Select the {{data-source}} that contains your data.
2. Configure the [**Slice by**](#slice-by-settings) dimension to define how the pie is divided into slices. Drag a categorical field to create slices based on its values.
3. Configure the [**Metric**](#metric-settings) dimension to define the size of each slice. This determines the numerical value that each slice represents. {{kib}} automatically selects an appropriate aggregation function compatible with the selected field.

Optionally:
   - Add additional **Slice by** dimensions to create nested slices (a multi-level or sunburst-style chart).
   - Enable [**Multiple metrics**](#multiple-metrics) in the layer settings to compare different measures within the same chart.

The chart preview updates to show a pie divided into slices. Each slice represents a category value, and its size reflects the metric proportion. If you added multiple **Slice by** dimensions, inner and outer rings appear to show the hierarchy.
:::::

:::::{step} Customize the chart to follow best practices
Tweak the appearance of the chart to your needs. Consider the following best practices:

**Limit the number of slices**
:   Keep your pie chart to a maximum of 6 slices. If you have more categories, consider [grouping smaller values into an "Other" category](#other-category) or using a different visualization type.

**Order slices meaningfully**
:   The largest slice should start at the 12 o'clock position and proceed clockwise in descending order. For categories with a natural order (such as satisfaction ratings), follow that order instead.

**Use color purposefully**
:   Apply colors to highlight important data or patterns. Use the [color mapping feature](../lens.md#assign-colors-to-terms) to assign consistent colors to key categories across your dashboards.

**Consider using a donut**
:   The empty center of donut charts provides space to display additional information, such as a total or key metric. Refer to [Create a donut chart](#donut-chart) for instructions.

**Label clearly**
:   Keep labels inside or close to slices when possible. For charts with many small slices or long labels, use the legend instead.

Refer to [Pie chart settings](#pie-chart-settings) to find all configuration options for your pie chart.
:::::

:::::{step} Save the chart
- If you accessed Lens from a dashboard, select **Save and return** to save the visualization and add it to that dashboard, or select **Save to library** to add the visualization to the Visualize library and reuse it later.
- If you accessed Lens from the Visualize library, select **Save**. A menu opens and lets you add the visualization to a dashboard and to the Visualize library.
:::::

## Advanced pie chart scenarios

### Create a donut chart [donut-chart]

Donut charts are pie charts with a hollow center. The empty space can provide a visual focal point and space for displaying related information.

1. Create a **Pie** chart visualization.
2. Configure your **Slice by** and **Metric** dimensions.
3. Select {icon}`brush` **Style**.
4. In **Appearance**, set **Donut hole** to **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large** depending on how much center space you want.

![Setting the donut hole size in Pie chart Style settings](/explore-analyze/images/pie-chart-donut.png "50%")

### Compare multiple metrics in a pie chart [multiple-metrics]

By default, pie charts use a single metric with **Slice by** to split that metric by values in a categorical field. The **Multiple metrics** option lets you take a different approach: each slice represents a distinct metric you define, rather than values from your data.

This is useful when:

* You want to compare metrics that apply different filters to the same aggregation
* You need to show custom-defined categories that don't exist as values in a field
* You want to compare different calculations or formulas side by side

#### Example: Server resource consumption

Imagine your web logs data includes multiple numeric fields representing different resource types, such as `response_bytes`, `processing_time_ms`, and `memory_used_kb`. You want to visualize how each resource contributes to overall server load.

1. Create a **Pie** chart and remove any existing **Slice by** dimension.
2. Open **Layer settings**:
   * {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3` Select {icon}`app_management` **Layer settings**.
   * {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.2` Select {icon}`boxes_vertical`, then select **Layer settings**.
3. Select **Multiple metrics**, then close the **Layer settings** menu.
4. Add metrics for each resource type:

   | Slice | Metric configuration |
   |-------|---------------------|
   | Bandwidth | `Sum(response_bytes)` |
   | Processing time | `Sum(processing_time_ms)` |
   | Memory usage | `Sum(memory_used_kb)` |

   For each metric, select the **Metric** dimension and configure the field. Customize the **Name** to display meaningful labels in the legend.

5. Optionally, assign custom colors to each metric by selecting the metric and choosing a **Series color**.

![Pie chart with three slices showing different server resource metrics](/explore-analyze/images/pie-chart-multiple-metrics-example.png)

This example demonstrates the core value of multiple metrics: comparing different numeric fields that represent distinct concepts. Unlike **Slice by**, which splits a single metric by category values, multiple metrics lets you place fundamentally different measurements side by side.

:::{note}
The {{kib}} sample data sets don't include multiple comparable numeric fields. To try this scenario, adapt the field names to match your own data.
:::

### Group smaller values into a single slice [other-category]

When you have many categories with small values, you can group them into an "Other" category to simplify the visualization.

1. In the **Slice by** configuration, select the field.
2. Use **Top values** to limit the number of slices displayed.
3. Expand **Advanced**.
4. Enable **Group other values as "Other"** to combine remaining values into a single slice.

:::{tip}
Be careful when using "Other", as it could end up being the largest category, which might obscure the meaning of your chart. Consider whether a bar chart might be more appropriate for data with many categories.
:::

#### Example: Top hosts with remaining grouped as "Other"

This example uses the **Kibana Sample Data Logs** data set. If you haven't installed it yet, refer to [Sample data](/manage-data/ingest/sample-data.md) for instructions.

1. Create a **Pie** chart using the **Kibana Sample Data Logs** {{data-source}}.
2. In the **Slice by** dimension, select `host.keyword` with **Top values** set to **3**.
3. Expand **Advanced** and make sure that the **Group other values as "Other"** option is active.
4. Set the **Metric** to the **Count** function.

The resulting chart shows the 3 most common hosts, with all remaining hosts combined into a single "Other" slice. This keeps the chart readable while still accounting for the full data set.

![Pie chart showing top 3 hosts with remaining hosts grouped as Other](/explore-analyze/images/pie-chart-group-as-other.png)

## Pie chart settings [pie-chart-settings]

Customize your pie chart to display exactly the information you need, formatted the way you want.

### Slice by settings [slice-by-settings]

The **Slice by** dimension defines how your pie is divided into segments. You can add up to 3 levels of slicing to create hierarchical visualizations.

**Data**
:   The **Slice by** dimension supports the following functions:

    - **Top values**: Create slices for the most common values in a field.
      - **Field**: Select the field to group by. You can add up to 4 fields to create multi-term slices. When multiple fields are selected, each slice represents a unique combination of values across those fields. You can reorder the fields by dragging them to change their priority.
      - **Number of values**: How many top values to display. The default number of values depends on your environment:
        - {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4` Defaults to 9.
        - {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.3` Defaults to 5.
      :::{include} ../../_snippets/lens-rank-by-options.md
      :::
      - **Collapse by**: Aggregate values into a single number using `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, or `Max`.
      :::{include} ../../_snippets/lens-breakdown-advanced-settings.md
      :::
    - **Date histogram**: Group data into time-based buckets (useful for showing time-based composition). Configure the time interval and how to handle date formatting.
      - **Field**: Select the date field to use for the time-based grouping.
      :::{include} ../../_snippets/lens-histogram-settings.md
      :::
      - **Collapse by**: Aggregate values into a single number using `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, or `Max`.
    - **Intervals**: Create numeric ranges for continuous data. Useful for grouping numeric fields into buckets. You can define the interval granularity or specify custom ranges.
      - **Field**: Select the numeric field to create intervals from.
      - **Include empty rows**: Include intervals with no matching documents. On by default.
      - **Collapse by**: Aggregate values into a single number using `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, or `Max`.
      :::{dropdown} How does interval granularity work?
      Interval granularity divides the field into evenly spaced intervals based on the minimum and maximum values for the field.
      
      The size of the interval is a "nice" value. When the granularity of the slider changes, the interval stays the same when the "nice" interval is the same. The minimum granularity is 1, and the maximum value is histogram:maxBars. To change the maximum granularity, go to Advanced settings.
      
      Intervals are incremented by 10, 5 or 2. For example, an interval can be `100` or `0.2`.
      :::
    - **Filters**: Define custom KQL filters to create specific slices. Each filter creates one slice in the chart.
      - **Collapse by**: Aggregate values into a single number using `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, or `Max`.

**Appearance**
:   Configure slice-level options:
    - **Name**: Customize the legend label.
    - **Color mapping**: Select a color palette or assign specific colors to categories. Refer to [Assign colors to terms](../lens.md#assign-colors-to-terms) for details.

### Metric settings [metric-settings]

The **Metric** dimension defines the size of each slice.

**Data**
:   The main value that appears prominently in your chart. When you drag a field onto the chart, {{kib}} suggests a function based on the field type. You can change it and use aggregation functions like `Sum`, `Average`, `Count`, `Median`, and more, or create custom calculations with formulas. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/visualize/lens.md#lens-formulas) for examples, or to the {icon}`documentation` **Formula reference** available from Lens.

    :::{include} ../../_snippets/lens-value-advanced-settings.md
    :::

**Appearance**
:   - **Name**: Customize the metric label displayed in tooltips and legends.
    - **Value format**: Control how numeric values are displayed (number, percent, bytes, and more).
    - **Series color**: When using multiple metrics without a **Slice by** dimension, use this option to assign a specific color to each metric.

### General layout [appearance-options]

When creating or editing a visualization, you can customize several appearance options from the {icon}`brush` **Style** or ![Legend icon](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-legend-icon.svg "") **Legend** menus.

#### Style settings

**Appearance**
:   Control the main visual aspects of the pie chart.

    **Donut hole**
    :   Transform your pie chart into a donut by adding a center hole:
        - **None**: Standard pie chart with no hole (default).
        - **Small**: Small center hole.
        - **Medium**: Medium center hole.
        - **Large**: Large center hole for emphasis or to display additional information.

**Titles and text**
:   Control slice labels and values.

    **Slice labels**
    :   Control how labels appear on the slices:
        - **Hide**: Do not display labels on slices.
        - **Inside**: Display labels inside the slices.
        - **Auto**: Automatically position labels for optimal readability (default).

    **Slice values**
    :   Control what values appear on the slices (when labels are visible):
        - **Hide**: Do not display values.
        - **Integer**: Display the raw numeric value.
        - **Percentage**: Display the percentage of the total.

          When displaying percentages, you can also configure the **Decimal places** (0-10) for precision.

#### Legend settings

Configure elements of your pie chart's legend:

**Visibility**
:   Specify whether to automatically show the legend or hide it:
    - **Auto**: Show the legend when there are multiple slices (default).
    - **Show**: Always show the legend.
    - **Hide**: Never show the legend.

**Nested**
:   When using multiple **Slice by** dimensions, enable this option to show the legend in a hierarchical format that reflects the slice hierarchy.

**Label truncation**
:   Choose whether to truncate long legend labels, and set a limit for how many lines to display.

**Width**
:   Set the width of the legend.
