# Using ES|QL [try-esql]

The Elasticsearch Query Language, {{esql}}, makes it easier to explore your data without leaving Discover.

The examples on this page use the {{kib}} sample web logs in Discover and Lens to explore the data and create visualizations. You can also install it by following [Add sample data](../index.md#gs-get-data-into-kibana).

::::{tip}
For the complete {{esql}} documentation, including all supported commands, functions, and operators, refer to the [{{esql}} reference](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax-reference.md). For a more detailed overview of {{esql}} in {{kib}}, refer to [Use {{esql}} in Kibana](../query-filter/languages/esql-kibana.md).

::::



## Prerequisite [prerequisite]

To view the {{esql}} option in **Discover**, the `enableESQL` setting must be enabled from Kibana’s **Advanced Settings**. It is enabled by default.


## Use {{esql}} [tutorial-try-esql]

To load the sample data:

1. Go to **Discover**.
2. Select **Try {{esql}}** from the application menu bar.

   :::{tip}
   If you've entered a KQL or Lucene query in the default mode of Discover, it automatically converts to ES|QL.
   :::

   Let’s say we want to find out what operating system users have and how much RAM is on their machine.

3. Set the time range to **Last 7 days**.
4. Copy the following query. To make queries more readable, you can put each processing command on a new line.

    ```esql
    FROM kibana_sample_data_logs <1>
    | KEEP machine.os, machine.ram <2>
    ```

    1. We’re specifically looking for data from the sample web logs we just installed.
    2. We’re only keeping the `machine.os` and `machine.ram` fields in the results table.
   
   ::::{note}
   {{esql}} keywords are not case sensitive.
   ::::

5. Click **▶Run**.

Let’s add `geo.dest` to our query to find out the geographical destination of the visits and limit the results.

1. Copy the query below:

    ```esql
    FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
    | KEEP machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
    | LIMIT 10
    ```

2. Click **▶Run** again. You can notice that the table is now limited to 10 results. The visualization also updated automatically based on the query, and broke down the data for you.
   ::::{note}
   When you don’t specify any specific fields to retain using `KEEP`, the visualization isn’t broken down automatically. Instead, an additional option appears above the visualization and lets you select a field manually.
   ::::
   ![An image of the extended query result](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-esql-limit.png "")


We will now take it a step further to sort the data by machine ram and filter out the `GB` destination.

1. Copy the query below:

    ```esql
    FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
    | KEEP machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
    | SORT machine.ram desc
    | WHERE geo.dest != "GB"
    | LIMIT 10
    ```

2. Click **▶Run** again. The table and visualization no longer show results for which the `geo.dest` field value is "GB", and the results are now sorted in descending order in the table based on the `machine.ram` field.

    ![An image of the full query result](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-esql-full-query.png "")

3. Click **Save** to save the query and visualization to a dashboard.


### Edit the ES|QL visualization [_edit_the_esql_visualization]

You can make changes to the visualization by clicking the pencil icon. This opens additional settings that let you adjust the chart type, axes, breakdown, colors, and information displayed to your liking. If you’re not sure which route to go, check one of the suggestions available in the visualization editor.

If you’d like to keep the visualization and add it to a dashboard, you can save it using the floppy disk icon.


### ES|QL and time series data [_esql_and_time_series_data]

By default, ES|QL identifies time series data when an index contains a `@timestamp` field. This enables the time range selector and visualization options for your query.

If your index doesn’t have an explicit `@timestamp` field, but has a different time field, you can still enable the time range selector and visualization options by calling the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters in your query.

For example, the eCommerce sample data set doesn’t have a `@timestamp` field, but has an `order_date` field.

By default, when querying this data set, time series capabilities aren’t active. No visualization is generated and the time picker is disabled.

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_ecommerce
| KEEP customer_first_name, email, products._id.keyword
```

:::{image} /explore-analyze/images/kibana-esql-no-time-series.png
:alt: ESQL query without time series capabilities enabled
:::

While still querying the same data set, by adding the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters based on the `order_date` field, **Discover** enables times series capabilities.

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_ecommerce
| WHERE order_date >= ?_tstart and order_date <= ?_tend
```

### Create and edit lookup indices from queries [discover-esql-lookup-join]
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.2
serverless: preview
```

In **Discover**, LOOKUP JOIN commands include interactive options that let you create or edit lookup indices directly from the editor.

#### Create a lookup index from the editor

You can create a lookup index directly from the ES|QL editor. To populate this index, you can type in data manually or upload a CSV file up to 500 MB.

To create lookup indices, you need the [`create_index`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/security-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) {{es}} privilege on the corresponding pattern.

1. In your {{esql}} query, add a `LOOKUP JOIN` command. For example:
   ```esql
   FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
   | LOOKUP JOIN
   ```
   Add a space after the command. The editor suggests existing lookup indices and offers to create one. You can also type an index name in your query. If it doesn't exist, the editor suggests to create it.

2. Select the **Create lookup index** suggestion that appears in the autocomplete menu.

3. Define a name for the lookup index, then validate it. 
   - It must not contain spaces nor any of the following characters: `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `:`, and `#`.
   - It must not start with `-`, `_`, or `+`.

4. Provide the data of the lookup index. You can choose between:
   - **Uploading a CSV file up to 500 MB**. When uploading a file, you can preview the data and inspect the file's content before it is imported. If issues are detected, a **File issues** tab with more details also appears before you validate the import.
   - **Adding data manually**. To do that, you can add rows and columns, and edit cells directly.
   - **Using a combination of both methods**. You can upload a file after adding data manually, and edit or expand data imported from a file.

   :::{tip}
   You can explore your index using the search field, or in a new Discover session by selecting **Open in Discover**. If you choose to open it in Discover, a new browser tab opens with a prefilled {{esql}} query on the index.
   :::

5. **Save** any unsaved changes, then **Close** the index editor to return to your query.

Your new index is automatically added to your query. You can then specify the field to join using `ON <field_to_join>`.

#### View or edit a lookup index from the editor

You can view and modify existing lookup indices referenced in an {{esql}} query directly from the editor, depending on your privileges:
- To edit lookup indices, you need the [`write`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/security-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) {{es}} privilege.
- To view lookup indices in read-only mode, you need the [`view_index_metadata`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/security-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) {{es}} privilege.

To view or edit an index:

1. In the {{esql}} query, hover over the lookup index name.

2. Select the **Edit lookup index** or **View lookup index** option that appears. A flyout showing the index appears.

3. Depending on your permissions and needs, explore or edit the index.

   :::{note}
   Editing a lookup index affects all {{esql}} queries that reference it. Make sure that your changes are compatible with existing queries that use this index.
   :::

4. If you made changes, select **Save** before closing the flyout.

### Add variable controls to your Discover queries [add-variable-control]
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.2
serverless: preview
```

Variable controls help you make your queries more dynamic instead of having to maintain several versions of almost identical queries.

![Variable control in Discover](/explore-analyze/images/variable-control-discover.png " =75%")

You can add them from your Discover {{esql}} query.

:::{include} ../_snippets/variable-control-procedure.md
:::

:::{include} ../_snippets/variable-control-examples.md
:::

#### Allow multi-value selections for {{esql}}-based variable controls [esql-multi-values-controls]
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.3
serverless: preview
```

:::{include} ../_snippets/multi-value-esql-controls.md
:::

#### Edit a variable control

Once a control is active for your query, you can still edit it by hovering over it and by selecting the {icon}`pencil` **Edit** option that appears.

You can edit all of the options described in [](#add-variable-control).

When you save your edits, the control is updated for your query.

#### Import a Discover query along with its controls into a dashboard
