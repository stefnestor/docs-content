# Dashboards [dashboard]

**Dashboards** provide the primary way to visualize and share insights from your {{es}} data. They allow you to build interactive displays that combine multiple visualizations, metrics, and controls into a single view that helps you and your team monitor trends, investigate issues, and make data-driven decisions.

A dashboard is composed of one or more **panels** that you arrange to tell your data story. Each panel can display visualizations such as charts, tables, metrics, and maps, static annotations like text or images, or specialized views for {{ml}} or {{observability}} data.

## About managed dashboards [managed-dashboards]

Some dashboards are created and managed by the system, and are identified as `managed` in your list of dashboards. This generally happens when you set up an integration to add data. You can't edit managed dashboards directly, but you can [duplicate](dashboards/duplicate-dashboards.md) them and edit the duplicates.
