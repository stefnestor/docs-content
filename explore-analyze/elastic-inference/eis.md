# Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service [elastic-inference-service-eis]

Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS) enables you to leverage AI-powered search as a service without deploying a model in your environment.
With EIS, you don't need to manage the infrastructure and resources required for {{ml}} {{infer}} by adding, configuring, and scaling {{ml}} nodes.
Instead, you can use {{ml}} models for ingest, search, and chat independently of your {{es}} infrastructure.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3` You can use EIS with your [self-managed](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md) cluster through Cloud Connect. For details, refer to [EIS for self-managed clusters](connect-self-managed-cluster-to-eis.md). 

## AI features powered by EIS [ai-features-powered-by-eis]

* Your Elastic deployment or project comes with [Elastic Managed LLMs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/kibana/connectors-kibana/elastic-managed-llm) by default. These can be used in Agent Builder, the AI Assistant, Attack Discovery, Automatic Import and Search Playground. For the list of available models, refer to [Supported models](#supported-models).

* You can use [ELSER](/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-elser.md) to perform semantic search as a service (ELSER on EIS). {applies_to}`stack: preview =9.1, ga 9.2+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`

* You can use the [`jina-embeddings-v3`](/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-jina.md#jina-embeddings-v3) multilingual dense vector embedding model to perform semantic search through the Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service. {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`

## Supported models

The following tables list the models supported by Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service by model type.

The corresponding {{kib}} connectors and {{infer}} endpoints for these models are created automatically. To customize the configuration, you can create [your own connectors](kibana://reference/connectors-kibana.md#creating-new-connector) or [{{infer}} endpoints](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-inference-put).

* The applicable terms of use, uptime, and performance for each of the AI models available with EIS are each described in the applicable AI model's Provider Terms and Model Card.
* Prior to using the AI model with EIS, Customers are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to the chosen AI model's Provider Terms to understand the availability and data practices of the AI model's provider.
* After the listed end-of-life (EOL) date, the model is no longer available for {{infer}} use and requests will fail. You need to actively transition to another model before the EOL date, there is no automated migration.
* Elastic makes every effort to use third party providers who do not use inputs to train models, and do not retain any data (zero data retention). Browse the tables on this page to double-check the status of a specific model.

## Region and hosting [eis-regions]

Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service is currently available in these regions:

**AWS:**

* `us-east-1` (Virginia)

**GCP:**

* `asia-southeast1` (Singapore)
* `europe-west1` (Belgium)
* `us-east4` (Virginia)

All {{infer}} requests sent through EIS are routed to the nearest region, regardless of where your {{es}} deployment or {{serverless-short}} project is hosted.

Depending on the model being used, request processing may involve Elastic {{infer}} infrastructure and, in some cases, trusted third-party model providers. For example, ELSER and Jina requests are processed entirely within Elastic {{infer}} infrastructure. Other models, such as large language models or third-party embedding models, may involve additional processing by their respective model providers, which can operate in different cloud platforms or regions.

## Rate limits

The service enforces rate limits on an ongoing basis. Exceeding a limit results in HTTP 429 responses from the server until the sliding window moves on further and parts of the limit resets.

## Pricing

All models on EIS incur a charge per million tokens. Certain LLM providers charge different prices depending on the prompt size. The pricing details are available on our [Pricing page](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search).

This pricing model differs from the existing [Machine Learning Nodes](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/data-frame-analytics/ml-trained-models), which is billed through VCUs consumed.

### Token-based billing

EIS is billed per million tokens used:

* For **chat** models, input and output tokens are billed. Longer conversations with extensive context or detailed responses will consume more tokens.
* For **embeddings** models, only input tokens are billed.

Tokens are the fundamental units that language models process for both input and output. Tokenizers convert text into numerical data by segmenting it into subword units. A token can be a complete word, part of a word, or a punctuation mark, depending on the model's trained tokenizer and the frequency patterns in its training data.

For example, the sentence `It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.` contains 52 characters but would tokenize into approximately 14 tokens with a typical word-based approach, though the exact count varies by tokenizer.

### Monitor your token usage

To track your token consumption:

1. Navigate to [**Billing > Usage**](https://cloud.elastic.co/billing/usage) in the {{ecloud}} Console.
2. Look for line items where the **Billing dimension** is set to "Inference".

## Use cases

The following sections describe how to get started with specific models available through Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service, including creating {{infer}} endpoints and using them for search and ingest.

### `jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` on EIS [jina-embeddings-v5-on-eis]

```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.4
serverless: preview
```

You can use the `jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` model through Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service. Running the model on EIS means that you use the model on GPUs, without the need of managing infrastructure and model resources.

#### Get started with `jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` on EIS

Create an {{infer}} endpoint that references the `jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` model in the `model_id` field.

```console
PUT _inference/text_embedding/eis-jina-embeddings-v5-text-small
{
  "service": "elastic",
  "service_settings": {
    "model_id": "jina-embeddings-v5-text-small"
  }
}
```

The created {{infer}} endpoint uses the model for {{infer}} operations on the Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service. You can reference the `inference_id` of the endpoint in index mappings for the [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) field type, text_embedding {{infer}} tasks, or search queries.

### `jina-embeddings-v3` on EIS [jina-embeddings-on-eis]

```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.3
serverless: preview
```

You can use the `jina-embeddings-v3` model through Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service. Running the model on EIS means that you use the model on GPUs, without the need of managing infrastructure and model resources.

#### Get started with `jina-embeddings-v3` on EIS

Create an {{infer}} endpoint that references the `jina-embeddings-v3` model in the `model_id` field.

```console
PUT _inference/text_embedding/eis-jina-embeddings-v3
{
  "service": "elastic",
  "service_settings": {
    "model_id": "jina-embeddings-v3"
  }
}
```

The created {{infer}} endpoint uses the model for {{infer}} operations on the Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service. You can reference the `inference_id` of the endpoint in index mappings for the [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) field type, text_embedding {{infer}} tasks, or search queries.

### ELSER through Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (ELSER on EIS) [elser-on-eis]

```{applies_to}
stack: preview =9.1, ga 9.2+
serverless: ga
```

ELSER on EIS enables you to use the ELSER model on GPUs, without having to manage your own ML nodes. We expect better performance for ingest throughput than ML nodes and equivalent performance for search latency. We will continue to benchmark, remove limitations and address concerns.

#### Using the ELSER on EIS endpoint

You can now use `semantic_text` with the new ELSER endpoint on EIS. To learn how to use the `.elser-2-elastic` inference endpoint, refer to [Using ELSER on EIS](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md#using-elser-on-eis).

##### Get started with semantic search with ELSER on EIS

[Semantic Search with `semantic_text`](/solutions/search/semantic-search/semantic-search-semantic-text.md) has a detailed tutorial on using the `semantic_text` field and using the ELSER endpoint on EIS instead of the default endpoint. This is a great way to get started and try the new endpoint.
