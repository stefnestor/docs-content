# Create case templates [create-case-templates]

Create a case template to pre-fill case defaults whenever your team opens a similar case. On the **Configuration** tab, you also set the template's identity, optional case settings, and an optional external connector. This guide shows you how to configure a template and author its YAML.

## Before you begin

* Your role must have the **Manage templates** sub-feature privilege for **Cases**. Refer to [Control access to cases](control-case-access.md#give-manage-templates-access).
* Review [what's in a template](manage-case-templates.md#case-templates-anatomy) and how it uses the [field library](manage-case-templates.md#case-templates-field-library).
* (Optional) [Create reusable fields](create-case-field-library.md) to include in the template.

## Create a template [case-templates-create-template]

The template editor has a YAML pane and a preview pane with **Fields** and **Configuration** tabs:

* **Fields**: Define case defaults and custom fields in YAML, and preview how they render on a case. Changes in the preview sync back to the YAML. Use the **Actions menu** to quickly insert scaffolding for any field type, pull in a reusable field from your library, or add validation and conditional logic.
* **Configuration**: Set the template's identity, case settings, and an optional external connector. These values aren't part of the YAML definition.

To create a template:

1. Find **Cases** using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md), then select **Templates** → **Create**.

   :::{note}
   Cases are [scoped by solution](create-cases.md#cases-limitations). On {{stack}}, search for `Security/Cases` or `Observability/Cases`, or go to **{{stack-manage-app}}** → **Cases**. On {{serverless-short}}, search for `Cases` in {{elastic-sec}} or {{observability}}.
   :::

2. On the **Fields** tab, define case defaults and the fields to pre-fill. Use the **Actions menu** to insert scaffolding for a new field, [reference a reusable field](#case-templates-field-ref) from your field library, or add validation and conditional logic. The preview pane updates in real time so you can see how fields look and behave before saving. Refer to the [YAML schema reference](yaml-template-schema-reference.md) for the full set of supported keys.

   :::{note}
   A template can have up to 200 custom fields. Refer to [Limits](yaml-template-schema-reference.md#case-templates-field-library-limits) for this and other template and field library size limits.
   :::

3. On the **Configuration** tab, enter a template name. Optionally add a description, tags, case settings (**Sync alerts** and **Extract observables**), and an external connector. 

   :::{note}
   **Extract observables** is available in {{elastic-sec}} only.
   :::

4. Select **Create**. The template is enabled by default so it's available when creating a case.

As you edit, the editor validates your YAML and suggests values. While you're editing, your changes are saved as a draft so you don't lose your work. Select **Reset** to discard the draft and return to the last saved version.

### Add reusable fields from the library [case-templates-field-ref]

Global fields appear on every case automatically, so you don't add them to a template. To include a reusable field, use the **Actions menu** and select **Field library**. Search for the field by name, select it, and the correct `$ref` YAML is inserted for you.

If you prefer to write the reference directly, use `$ref` with the field's `name` (not its label) on the **Fields** tab. Use the field's `label` when you [search cases](search-share-cases.md#search-case-field-values).

For example, to add the `summary` field from the library:

```yaml
fields:
  - $ref: summary
```

A reference can also use a different name for that template, or override the field's default value, without changing the original field in the library:

```yaml
fields:
  - $ref: summary
    name: incident_summary
    metadata:
      default: A different default for this template
```

## What to do next with case templates [create-case-templates-next-steps]

From here, you can use the template on cases and update it later if your workflow changes.

- [Create a case](create-cases.md): Select a template to pre-fill fields when opening a case.
- [Apply a template to an existing case](manage-cases.md#apply-case-template): Update an open case with values from an enabled template.
- [Edit and share case templates](edit-case-templates.md): Edit, clone, delete, or import and export templates.
