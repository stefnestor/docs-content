# Case analytics field reference [case-analytics-fields]

Use this page as a reference for the fields you can query in the [case analytics indices](case-analytics-indices.md) when you're looking for specific case data.

Most fields use the singular `case.*` prefix, such as `case.status`, even though the index names are plural, such as `.cases`. A few fields, including `owner`, `space_id`, and `@timestamp`, sit at the top level without the `case.*` prefix.

:::{note}
Fields with the `date` type use ISO 8601 format, set to the server's time zone, such as `2025-07-27T14:30:00.000Z`.
:::

## General case data (`.cases`) [case-analytics-fields-cases]

The `.cases` index holds one document per case, with the current state of each case.

### Identity [case-analytics-fields-identity]

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@timestamp` | date | When {{es}} last wrote this document, which tracks the case's last update. |
| `space_id` | keyword | The space the case belongs to. |
| `owner` | keyword | The solution that owns the case: `securitySolution` for {{elastic-sec}}, `observability` for {{observability}}, or `cases` for {{stack-manage-app}} (unavailable in {{serverless-short}}). |
| `case.id` | keyword | The case UUID. Join key for the activity and attachment indices. For more information, refer to [UUID](search-share-cases.md#case-identifiers). |
| `case.incremental_id` | unsigned_long | The sequential case number shown in the UI. For more information, refer to [numeric ID](search-share-cases.md#case-identifiers). |

### Core attributes [case-analytics-fields-core]

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case.title` | text | Case title. Also indexed as `case.title.keyword` for aggregation and sorting. |

| `case.tags` | keyword | Tags applied to the case. |
| `case.category` | keyword | Case category. |
| `case.status` | keyword | Case status: `open`, `in-progress`, or `closed`. |
| `case.severity` | keyword | Case severity: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`. |
| `case.assignees.uid` | keyword | Profile UIDs of the case's assignees (a case can have several), not display names. To resolve a UID to a name, look it up with the [user profile API]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-security-get-user-profile), or match it to `actor.profile_uid` in `.cases-activity`, which also carries `actor.username`, `.full_name`, and `.email`. The `.cases-activity` method only resolves users who have acted on a case. |

### Timestamps and timing metrics [case-analytics-fields-timing]

Timing fields store values in seconds and are `null` until the case reaches the corresponding state. Divide by `3600` for hours.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case.created_at` | date | When the case was created. |
| `case.updated_at` | date | When the case was last updated. |
| `case.in_progress_at` | date | When the case first moved to `in-progress`. |
| `case.closed_at` | date | When the case was closed. `null` while the case is open. |
| `case.duration` | unsigned_long | Total time from open to closed, in seconds. |
| `case.time_to_acknowledge` | long | Time from creation to first moving to `in-progress`, in seconds. |
| `case.time_to_investigate` | long | Time from `in-progress` to resolution, in seconds. |
| `case.time_to_resolve` | long | Time from creation to resolution, in seconds. |

### People [case-analytics-fields-people]

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case.created_by.username` | keyword | Username of the case creator. Also includes `.email`, `.full_name`, and `.profile_uid`. |
| `case.updated_by.username` | keyword | Username of the last editor. Also includes `.email`, `.full_name`, and `.profile_uid`. |

### Counters [case-analytics-fields-counters]

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case.total_alerts` | integer | Number of alerts attached to the case. |
| `case.total_comments` | integer | Number of user comments on the case. |
| `case.total_events` | integer | Number of attached events. |
| `case.total_observables` | integer | Number of observables on the case. |

### Template and case fields [case-analytics-fields-template]

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `case.template.id` | keyword | ID of the template applied when the case was created, if any. |
| `case.template.version` | integer | Version of the applied template. |
| `case.extended_fields` | flattened | Template field values, keyed as `<name>_as_<type>`. Query the keys with `FIELD_EXTRACT` or a `terms` aggregation. Refer to [Analyze case fields](analyze-case-fields.md). |
| `case.customFields.key` | keyword | Key of a custom field. Paired with `.type` and `.value`. |
| `case.customFields.type` | keyword | The custom field's type. |
| `case.customFields.value` | keyword | The custom field's value, with typed sub-fields `.boolean`, `.date`, `.ip`, `.number`, and `.string`. |

:::{note}
`case.customFields` holds a case's custom field values in raw form and is populated for current cases. Because it's a `nested` field, you can't query it with {{esql}}. Use Query DSL `nested` queries and aggregations instead. For values defined by a template or the field library, use `case.extended_fields`, which supports {{esql}} and typed fields. Refer to [Analyze case fields](analyze-case-fields.md).

## JSON payload fields [case-analytics-fields-json]

The `.cases-activity` and `.cases-attachments` indices include dedicated fields for the most common values, and also store each full record as JSON:

* `action.payload_json` holds the full case action payload.
* `attachment.data_json` holds the full attachment payload.
* `attachment.metadata_json` holds the full attachment metadata.

These JSON fields have no length limit. Query them with {{esql}} to reach any detail that doesn't have its own field.
