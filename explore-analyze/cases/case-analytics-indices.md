# Case analytics indices [case-analytics-indices]

Elastic mirrors your case data into dedicated analytics indices that are built for reporting and aggregation. This page describes those indices and how often they refresh. To let users report on this data, [grant access to the case analytics indices](control-case-access.md#give-analytics-access).

## Indices [case-analytics-indices-list]

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { "stack": "ga 9.5", "serverless": "ga" }
{{es}} automatically creates three analytics indices and keeps them in sync with your case data:

| Index | What it holds | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.cases` | One document per case, with each case's current details | Status, severity, assignees, and timing metrics |
| `.cases-activity` | One document per action taken on a case | A status change, severity change, or comment |
| `.cases-attachments` | One document per item attached to a case | An alert, comment, file, dashboard, or visualization |

The `.cases-activity` and `.cases-attachments` indices join back to `.cases` on the `case.id` field.

These indices store status and severity as readable text and precalculate common timing metrics like time to resolve. They hold data from {{elastic-sec}}, {{observability}}, and {{stack-manage-app}} together, so use the `owner` and `space_id` fields to filter by solution or space.

:::{important}
Field names use the singular `case.*` form, such as `case.status`. A plural path like `cases.status` isn't a valid field, and the {{esql}} query fails.
:::

For the fields available in each index, refer to [Case analytics field reference](case-analytics-fields.md).

::::{applies-item} stack: preview 9.2-9.4
{{es}} automatically creates the analytics indices for you, so you don't need to create them or manage their lifecycle policies. It creates a separate set of indices for each solution in every space that has cases.

{{es}} names each index `.internal.<type>.<solution>-<space-name>`, with a matching alias that drops the `.internal` prefix. For example, Security case attachments in the `default` space use the index `.internal.cases-attachments.securitysolution-default` and the alias `.cases-attachments.securitysolution-default`.

Combine a type and a solution to build the name for the data you want:

| `<type>` | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `cases` | General case data |
| `cases-comments` | Case comments |
| `cases-attachments` | Case attachments |
| `cases-activity` | Case activity |

| Solution | `<solution>` |
| --- | --- |
| {{stack-manage-app}} | `cases` |
| {{observability}} | `observability` |
| Security | `securitysolution` |

:::{important}
In {{stack}} 9.2.x-9.4.x, fields are unprefixed. For example, use `status` and `time_to_resolve`, not `case.status`. This differs from 9.5 and later, where fields use the `case.*` prefix.

## Data freshness [case-analytics-data-freshness]

:::::{applies-switch}

::::{applies-item} { "stack": "ga 9.5", "serverless": "ga" }
Case analytics keeps your data current in two ways:

1. It updates the indices as soon as you create, edit, or delete a case.
2. As a backup, a background task checks for recently changed cases on a regular schedule (about every 30 minutes) and fills in anything the immediate update missed.

Because updates take a moment to apply, a new or edited case can take a short time to appear in your queries.
::::

::::{applies-item} stack: preview 9.2-9.4
A background task refreshes the analytics indices every five minutes with a snapshot of the most current case data. During each refresh, {{es}} overwrites the historical case data.

:::{note}
- After you create a case, indexing the new case data can take up to 10 minutes.
- After you create a space, the case analytics indices for that space can take up to an hour to form.
