# AI chat experiences

AI chat can help with a wide range of tasks throughout {{kib}}, such as helping to answer questions about your data, suggesting next steps, and explaining how to use Elastic's software.

There are two AI chat experiences which you can choose from:

- {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview` **AI Agent**: Powered by [{{agent-builder}}](/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder.md), this chat experience lets you create custom agents for specific tasks, with specialized tools, and provides a unified chat experience across all of {{kib}}.
- [AI Assistant](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-assistant.md): Elastic's original AI chat, AI Assistant offers features like chat sharing, data anonymization, and knowledge base that are not yet present in Agent Builder. The AI Assistant for {{observability}} and {{es}} operates independently from the AI Assistant for Security.

To compare them and learn how to switch between them, refer to [](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md).
