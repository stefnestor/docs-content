# Self-managed custom LLMs

You can set up connectors for self-managed LLMs to maintain more control of your data, operate in an air-gapped environment, or use specific open-source models of your choosing.

The following guides describe how to set up self-managed LLMs for {{elastic-sec}} and {{observability}}.

**Self-managed LLMs for {{elastic-sec}}:** 

- For production environments or air-gapped environments, you can [connect to vLLM](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/connect-to-vLLM.md).
- For test environments, you can [connect to LM Studio](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/connect-to-lmstudio-security.md).

**Self-managed LLMs for {{observability}}:**

- For test environments, you can [connect to LM Studio](/explore-analyze/ai-features/llm-guides/connect-to-lmstudio-observability.md).
