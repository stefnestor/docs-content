# Limitations and known issues in {{agent-builder}}

This section lists the limitations and known issues in {{agent-builder}}.

::::{admonition}
This feature requires the appropriate {{stack}} [subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing) or {{serverless-short}} [project feature tier](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md).
::::

## Limitations

:::{tip}
Refer to [Get started](get-started.md#access-agent-builder) if you need instructions about enabling {{agent-builder}} for your deployment type.
:::

### Cross-cluster search not supported in index search tools

Index search tool types do not yet support [cross-cluster search (CCS)](/explore-analyze/cross-cluster-search.md).

### A2A streaming not supported

The [A2A server](a2a-server.md) does not currently support streaming operations. All agent interactions use the synchronous `message/send` method, which returns a complete response only after task execution completes.

### {{esql}} limitations

{{esql}} tools are subject to the current limitations of the [{{esql}} language](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql.md).

Ensure your cluster version supports the {{esql}} features you intend to use.

For a complete list of {{esql}} limitations, refer to the [{{esql}} limitations documentation](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/limitations.md).

## Known issues

### Troubleshoot incompatible LLMs

The following errors suggest your selected model may not be compatible with {{agent-builder}}:

```console-response
Error: Invalid function call syntax
```

```console-response
Error executing agent: No tool calls found in the response.
```

To learn more, refer to [](models.md).

### Context length exceeded error [conversation-length-exceeded]

This error occurs when a conversation exceeds the maximum context length supported by the LLM. This typically happens when tools return large responses that consume the available token budget.

To learn more, refer to [Context length exceeded in {{agent-builder}} conversations](troubleshooting/context-length-exceeded.md).

### Misinterpreted SQL syntax as ES|QL

The `.execute_esql` tool is designed only for [{{esql}}](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql.md) syntax, not other query languages.

When using SQL syntax with the default agent, it attempts to use the `.execute_esql` tool instead of recognizing the input as SQL.

This results in parsing errors like this:
```console-response
[
  {
    "type": "error",
    "data": {
      "message": "parsing_exception\n\tCaused by:\n\t\tinput_mismatch_exception: null\n\tRoot causes:\n\t\tparsing_exception: line 1:15: mismatched input 'WHERE' expecting {<EOF>, '|', ',', 'metadata'}",
      "stack": "ResponseError: parsing_exception\n\tCaused by:\n\t\tinput_mismatch_exception: null\n\tRoot causes:\n\t\tparsing_exception: line 1:15: mismatched input 'WHERE' expecting {<EOF>, '|', ',', 'metadata'}\n    at KibanaTransport._request (Desktop/Dev/kibana/node_modules/@elastic/elasticsearch/node_modules/@elastic/transport/src/Transport.ts:591:17)\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)\n    at Desktop/Dev/kibana/node_modules/@elastic/elasticsearch/node_modules/@elastic/transport/src/Transport.ts:697:22\n    at KibanaTransport.request (Desktop/Dev/kibana/node_modules/@elastic/elasticsearch/node_modules/@elastic/transport/src/Transport.ts:694:14)"
    }
  }
]
```

### MCP server URL copy button omits space name

:::{note}
Fixed on serverless and 9.3.
:::

On 9.2 deployments, the **Copy your MCP server URL** button does not include the space name when used from a custom {{kib}} Space.

**Workaround:** Manually add `/s/<space-name>` to the URL. For example: `https://<deployment>/s/<space-name>/api/agent_builder/mcp`

For more information about {{agent-builder}} and Spaces, refer to [Permissions and access control](permissions.md#working-with-spaces).
