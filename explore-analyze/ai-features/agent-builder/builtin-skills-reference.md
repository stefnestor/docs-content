# {{agent-builder}} built-in skills reference

This page lists all built-in skills available in {{agent-builder}}. Skills give agents domain-specific knowledge and tools for common task types. Built-in skills are read-only: you can't modify or delete them.

:::{tip}
For an overview of how skills work in {{agent-builder}}, refer to [Skills in {{agent-builder}}](skills.md).
:::

## Availability

Skills are solution-scoped: the set of available built-in skills depends on your deployment type. Platform skills are available across all deployments. Observability, Security, and Elasticsearch skills are available in their respective serverless projects or solution views.

Some skills are in technical preview or require an [advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#kibana-general-settings) or experimental feature flag to be turned on before they appear. These requirements are called out in each skill's entry.

## Platform skills

Platform skills are available across all deployment types. They cover core capabilities such as visualizations, dashboards, cases, alerting rules, streams, significant events, and workflows.

### Core skills

$$$agent-builder-visualization-creation-skill$$$ `visualization-creation` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+`
:   Creates standalone or reusable Lens or Vega-Lite visualizations from index and field context. Use when a user asks for a chart, metric, trend, or breakdown visualization, or wants to update an existing one.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools
    `platform.core.generate_esql`, `platform.core.execute_esql`, `platform.core.create_visualization`

    :::

$$$agent-builder-graph-creation-skill$$$ `graph-creation` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+`
:   Creates graph attachments by transforming relationship data into nodes and edges rendered inline in the conversation. Use for topology, dependency, or entity-link visualizations.

$$$agent-builder-dashboard-management-skill$$$ `dashboard-management` {applies_to}`stack: preview =9.4, ga 9.5+`
:   Composes and updates in-memory {{kib}} dashboards. Use when a user asks to find, create, or modify a dashboard, add or remove panels, or edit existing panel visualizations.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools
    A skill-scoped inline tool for generating and updating dashboards.

    :::

$$$agent-builder-discover-data-analysis-skill$$$ `discover-data-analysis` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
:   Analyzes {{esql}} query results in {{kib}} **Discover**, identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies by running aggregation queries against the full dataset. The skill receives the current query, columns, sample rows, and time range as an attachment, then runs 2 to 3 focused aggregation queries, renders an inline visualization for the main finding, and proposes drill-down queries. When the active [context-aware profile](/explore-analyze/discover/discover-get-started.md#context-aware-discover) is logs, metrics, or traces, the skill receives shape-specific guidance. For example, it uses the {{esql}} `TS` source command for time series metrics.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools
    `platform.core.generate_esql`, `platform.core.execute_esql`, `platform.core.search`, `platform.core.list_indices`, `platform.core.product_documentation`, `platform.core.create_visualization`

    :::

    **How to activate:** Activates from the [standard activation methods](skills.md#how-skills-are-invoked) when the conversation is started from a Discover session tab that is in {{esql}} mode and has loaded results. The current query, columns, sample rows, and time range are automatically attached to the conversation, so the agent has the context it needs to run the analysis. Refer to [Analyze your data with AI](/explore-analyze/discover/discover-get-started.md#analyze-with-ai) for the full workflow.

$$$agent-builder-traces-skill$$$ `agent-builder-traces` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
:   Answers questions about {{agent-builder}} OpenTelemetry (OTel) traces and activity, including token usage, model and provider breakdowns, conversation and agent latency, tool-call volume, and error rates, and can help build dashboards from that trace data. The skill queries the {{agent-builder}} OTel traces with {{esql}} and is part of the default Elastic AI Agent.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools
    `platform.core.execute_esql`, plus an internal {{esql}} generation tool scoped to trace data.

    :::

    **Prerequisites:** Controlled by the `agentBuilder:tracing:enabled` [advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#kibana-general-settings), which is on by default.

### Cases and alerting

$$$agent-builder-cases-management-skill$$$ `cases-management` {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
:   Manages investigation and incident cases across {{elastic-sec}}, {{observability}}, and Stack Management. Covers creating, updating, searching, and enriching cases with comments, alerts, events, and observables such as indicators of compromise.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools

### Streams and significant events

$$$agent-builder-streams-management-skill$$$ `streams-management` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: ga`
:   Explores and manages {{es}} streams. Use when a user mentions streams, stream names such as `logs.ecs` or `logs.otel`, data quality, processing pipelines, or ingestion failures. The skill can inspect stream definitions, schema, quality, lifecycle, and documents, and can modify processing, retention, partitions, field mappings, the failure store, and descriptions. This skill replaces the earlier `streams-exploration` skill and adds the ability to modify stream configuration.

    :::{dropdown} Assigned tools
    `platform.streams.inspect_streams`, `platform.streams.diagnose_stream`, `platform.streams.query_documents`, `platform.streams.design_pipeline`, `platform.streams.list_ilm_policies`, `platform.streams.update_stream`, `platform.streams.create_partition`, `platform.streams.delete_stream`

    :::

$$$agent-builder-streams-exploration-skill$$$ `streams-exploration` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4, removed 9.5`
:   Discovers, inspects, and queries {{es}} streams. Use when a user wants to list available streams, understand a stream's schema, check data quality or retention, or sample documents from a stream. This is a read-only skill: it cannot create, update, or delete streams or modify stream configuration. In 9.5, this skill is replaced by [`streams-management`](#agent-builder-streams-management-skill), which adds stream modification capabilities.

<!-- TODO(agent-builder): The following significant events and Knowledge Indicators skills are gated by the `streams.significantEventsAvailable` feature flag, which defaults to off and is controlled by Elastic, not a user-facing advanced setting. The investigation skill also needs `streams.investigationEnabled`. Commented out until the flag is generally available, at which point restore them with the correct applies_to lifecycle. streams-management above is not gated and stays live. -->
