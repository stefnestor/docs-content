# Permissions and access control in {{agent-builder}}

Use this page to learn how to configure security roles and API keys for {{agent-builder}}. Understanding these privileges helps you control who can use agents, which tools they can access, and what data they can query.

:::{important}
{{agent-builder}} requires an **Enterprise [subscription](/deploy-manage/license.md)** for {{ech}} or self-managed deployments.
:::

## Required privileges

{{agent-builder}} requires privileges at three levels:

- [{{kib}} feature access](#kib-privileges)
- [{{es}} cluster access](#es-cluster-privileges)
- [{{es}} index access](#es-index-privileges)

### {{kib}} privileges

{{agent-builder}} access control is managed by the `agentBuilder` {{kib}} feature:

- "Read" access to the `agentBuilder` feature: Required to use agents, send chat messages, view tools, and access conversations.
- "All" access to the `agentBuilder` feature: Required to create, update, or delete custom agents and tools.
- "Read" access to the "Actions and Connectors" feature: Required to use AI connectors with agents. 

Learn more about [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).

### {{es}} cluster privileges

{{agent-builder}} requires cluster-level privileges for AI-powered query generation:

- `monitor_inference`: Required when the agent uses an AI connector that calls the {{es}} Inference API (such as the Elastic default LLM or other AI connectors configured to use the Inference API). The built-in tools `search` and `generate_esql`, as well as [index search tools](tools/index-search-tools.md), use this API to generate queries from natural language. This privilege is not required when the agent uses other {{kib}} GenAI connectors.

Learn more about [cluster privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster).

### {{es}} index privileges

Tools execute queries against {{es}} indices as the current user. Required privileges depend on which indices the tools access:

- `read`: Required for tools that query data.
- `view_index_metadata`: Required for tools that inspect index structure. Also required for the built-in `search` tool and [index search tools](tools/index-search-tools.md), which may use index exploration capabilities internally.

Learn more about [index privileges](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/security-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices).

## Grant access

You can grant users access to {{agent-builder}} using these methods:

- [Roles](#grant-access-with-roles) to bundle privileges for users.
- [API keys](#grant-access-with-api-keys) for programmatic access.
- [Spaces](#working-with-spaces) to scope access to specific environments.

### Grant access with roles

[Roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md) are {{es}} security constructs that bundle together {{kib}} feature privileges and {{es}} privileges. To grant users access to {{agent-builder}}, create a role that includes the required privileges.

:::{note}
When configuring roles in the {{kib}} UI, {{agent-builder}} privileges are currently located under the **Analytics** section, not the {{es}} section.
:::

Example role for users who need full {{agent-builder}} access:

```json
POST /_security/role/agent-builder-full
{
  "cluster": ["monitor_inference"],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": ["logs-*", "metrics-*"],
      "privileges": ["read", "view_index_metadata"]
    }
  ],
  "applications": [
    {
      "application": "kibana-.kibana",
      "privileges": [
        "feature_agentBuilder.all",
        "feature_actions.read"
      ],
      "resources": ["space:default"]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::{tip}
For read-only access, use `feature_agentBuilder.read` instead of `feature_agentBuilder.all`.
:::

### Grant access with API keys

When using the {{agent-builder}} APIs programmatically, authenticate with an API key that includes the required privileges.

Unlike roles, which use UI-friendly feature privilege names like `feature_agentBuilder.all`, API keys use the underlying API privilege names (`read_onechat`, `manage_onechat`). This is because API keys interact directly with the {{kib}} API layer rather than through the UI.

Refer to these pages for API key configuration examples:
- [MCP server](mcp-server.md#api-key-application-privileges)
- [{{kib}} API](kibana-api.md)

Learn more about [API keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys/elasticsearch-api-keys.md).

### Working with Spaces

{{agent-builder}} respects {{kib}} Spaces when enabled. All conversations, custom agents, and custom tools are scoped to the current Space.

When configuring roles or API keys, specify the Space in the application privileges resources (e.g., `"resources": ["space:production"]`). Users and API keys cannot access resources in other Spaces.

Learn how to [Copy your MCP server URL](tools.md#copy-your-mcp-server-url).

:::{important}
When accessing {{agent-builder}} APIs or the MCP server from a custom Space, include the space name in the URL path: `https://<deployment>/s/<space-name>/api/agent_builder/...`

The default space uses the standard URL format without `/s/<space-name>`.
