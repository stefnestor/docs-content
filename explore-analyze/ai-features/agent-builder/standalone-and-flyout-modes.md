# Standalone and flyout chat UI modes in {{agent-builder}}

The {{agent-builder}} [chat UI](chat.md#agent-chat-gui) is available in two modes: 

1. [Standalone mode](#standalone-mode)
2. [Flyout mode](#flyout-mode)

:::{note}
The standalone and flyout modes have the same functionalities and can be used interchangeably. Conversation history is preserved across both modes.
:::

## Standalone mode

```{applies_to}
stack: preview =9.2, ga 9.3
serverless: ga
```

Access Agent Builder by selecting **Agents** in the main navigation. In {{product.observability}} and {{product.security}}, the standalone experience is available when you [switch from AI Assistant to Agent Builder](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md#switch-between-chat-experiences).

## Flyout mode

```{applies_to}

serverless: preview
```

Once you [switch from AI Assistant to Agent Builder](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md#switch-between-chat-experiences), you can access the flyout in two ways:

1. Select the **AI Agent** button from the header bar in any page:

2. Use the keyboard shortcut:
   - Mac: {kbd}`cmd+;`
   - Windows/Linux: {kbd}`ctrl+;`

You can resize the flyout by dragging its side edge. The flyout persists when you change pages in the main navigation.

## Default chat experiences

The default chat experience varies by solution:

- **{{product.observability}} and {{product.security}}:** Each solution's classic AI Assistant is the default chat experience. You must [switch between chat experiences](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md#switch-between-chat-experiences) to enable Agent Builder.
  - Once enabled:
    - The flyout experience replaces the AI Assistant chat experience
    - The standalone experience is available through the **Agents** button in the main navigation.
- **{{es}}:** Agent Builder appears in the navigation automatically.
