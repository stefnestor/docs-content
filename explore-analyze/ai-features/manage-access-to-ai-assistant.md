The **GenAI Settings** page has the following settings:

- **Default AI Connector**: Use this setting to specify which connector is selected by default when you access AI-powered features. Default setting: **No default connector**.
  - If **No default connector** is selected, AI-powered features will default to the connector that was most recently used in your environment. 
  - If **Elastic Managed LLM** or a custom LLM connector is selected, AI-powered features will default to that connector regardless of which connector was used most recently in your environment. 
- **Disallow all other connectors**: When this setting is disabled, whenever you use an AI-powered feature you can select which connector should power it. Enable it to prevent connectors other than the default connector from being used in your space. Default setting: disabled.
- **AI feature visibility**: This button opens the current Space's settings page, where you can specify which features are enabled in your environment, including AI-powered features. 
- **Chat experience**: {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.3+` Select whether to use AI Assistant or AI Agent. For information about choosing one, refer to [Compare AI Agent and AI Assistant](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md).
- **AI Assistant visibility**: This setting allows you to choose which AI Assistants are available to use and where. There are several options:
  - **Only in their solutions** (default): The Security AI Assistant appears in {{elastic-sec}}, and the {{obs-ai-assistant}} appears in {{es}} and {{observability}}.
  - **{{obs-ai-assistant}} in other apps**: The {{obs-ai-assistant}} appears throughout {{kib}} regardless of solution. The Security AI Assistant does not appear anywhere.
  - **Security AI Assistant in other apps**: The Security AI Assistant appears throughout {{kib}} regardless of solution. The {{obs-ai-assistant}} does not appear anywhere.
  - **Hide all assistants**: Turns off AI Assistant throughout {{kib}}.
