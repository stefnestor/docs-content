# Jina models [ml-nlp-jina]

Jina models are designed and trained for search and retrieval workflows. You can use them to create embeddings for text and multimodal semantic similarity search, rerank candidate results to improve the precision of hybrid search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and extract structured content from HTML and complex documents before indexing.

## Model overview [jina-model-overview]

The following tables list the available Jina models and show where each model can be deployed and how you can access it.

* **Deployment** describes where the model can run: Elastic Hosted, Elastic Serverless, the hosted Jina platform, cloud marketplaces, or on-prem.
* **Access** describes how you call the model: through [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)](#jina-eis-getting-started), the [Jina API](#jina-external), or a [cloud marketplace endpoint](#jina-cloud-marketplaces-access). For setup details, refer to [Access models](#jina-access).

Select a deployment or access option to view the corresponding setup and usage instructions.

::::{note}
For models accessed through [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md), availability may vary by Stack version. For supported models and version requirements, refer to [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service supported models](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis-supported-models.md).

#### Performance considerations [jina-text-embeddings-performance]

::::{tab-set}
:group: jina-text-embeddings

:::{tab-item} jina-embeddings-v5-text-small
:sync: text-small

- `jina-embeddings-v5-text-small` works best on small, medium or large sized fields that contain natural language. For connector or web crawler use cases, this aligns best with fields like title, description, summary, or abstract.
- Although the model supports an input token length of 32K, consider chunking very large fields to control latency and cost.
- Larger documents take longer at ingestion time, and {{infer}} time per document also increases the more fields in a document that need to be processed.
- The more fields your pipeline has to perform {{infer}} on, the longer it takes per document to ingest.

:sync: omni-small

- Use short video clips instead of long videos. Embeddings created from long videos are often less accurate for search because they try to represent too much content at once. Splitting videos into short clips or scenes improves retrieval quality.
- Image, video, and audio {{infer}} is typically more expensive than text alone. Batch and chunk content to control latency and cost.
- For long text fields: the model supports an input token length of 32K, but splitting very large passages into chunks often improves latency and per-chunk quality.

## Deploy models [jina-deploy]

You can deploy Jina models in the following environments.

### Elastic Hosted and Elastic Serverless [jina-elastic-hosted]

Models run on Elastic infrastructure. Access them through [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)](#jina-eis-getting-started).

### Jina [jina-hosted]

Models run on the hosted [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) platform. Access them through the [Jina API](#jina-external): with a [direct API call](#jina-direct-api), through [External {{infer}}](#jina-external-infer) in {{es}}, or [on-prem](#jina-on-prem).

### Cloud Marketplaces [jina-cloud-marketplaces]

Selected models are available on providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. After you deploy a model in your cloud account, you call the provider endpoint. For details, refer to [Cloud marketplace endpoints](#jina-cloud-marketplaces-access).

### On-prem [jina-on-prem-overview]

Models run in Docker containers on your own infrastructure. Access them through the [Jina API](#jina-on-prem), including from {{es}} {{infer}} endpoints where supported.

## Access models [jina-access]

You can access models in the following ways:

* [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)](#jina-eis-getting-started): Call models through managed Elastic {{infer}} endpoints.
* [Jina API](#jina-external): Call models through the hosted Jina API or through Jina API schemas on-prem.
* [Cloud marketplace endpoints](#jina-cloud-marketplaces-access): Call models you deployed in your cloud provider account.

### Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service [jina-eis-getting-started]

With [Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS)](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md), Elastic hosts Jina models on Elastic Hosted and Elastic Serverless and serves them through managed {{infer}} endpoints in your cluster. Use this option when you want GPU-accelerated inference without deploying or managing model infrastructure.

To use a model through EIS, create an {{infer}} endpoint with `"service": "elastic"` and set `model_id` to the name of the model you want to use.

#### Text embedding models [jina-eis-text-embedding]

The following examples use the `text_embedding` task type. Create an {{infer}} endpoint and reference the `inference_id` in `text_embedding` {{infer}} tasks or search queries:

::::{tab-set}

::::{note}
The Jina v5 omni models availability and the support for the [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) field type depend on your {{stack}} version:

- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.3+` In {{stack}} 9.3 and later, you can create endpoints and run multimodal `embedding` {{infer}} requests. You cannot use these models with the [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) field type.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` In {{stack}} 9.4 and later, you can use [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) mappings for text-only embeddings at ingest and search time.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.5+` In {{stack}} 9.5 and later, the `semantic` field type supports all modalities, such as text, images, video, audio, and documents.

### Jina API [jina-external]

You can use the Jina API in the following ways:

* [Jina API (hosted)](#jina-api-hosted): Call models hosted on the Jina AI platform
    * [Direct API call](#jina-direct-api): Send HTTP requests to the hosted Jina API
    * [External {{infer}}](#jina-external-infer): Call the hosted Jina API through {{es}} {{infer}} endpoints
* [On-prem](#jina-on-prem): Run models on your own infrastructure, then call the Jina API schemas exposed locally.

#### Jina API (hosted) [jina-api-hosted]

When models run on the [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) platform, you call them through the hosted Jina API. To create a Jina AI API key, refer to [Get your Jina API key](https://jina.ai/api-dashboard/key-manager).

##### Direct API call [jina-direct-api]

Call the hosted Jina API with an HTTP request. The following example uses `curl` to send a `rerank` request for `jina-colbert-v2`:

```bash
curl https://api.jina.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "jina-colbert-v2",
    "query": "star wars main character",
    "documents": ["luke", "like", "leia", "chewy", "r2d2", "star", "wars"]
  }'
```

##### External {{infer}} [jina-external-infer]

Connect {{es}} to the hosted Jina API through {{infer}} endpoints. Refer to [External {{infer}}](docs-content://explore-analyze/elastic-inference/external.md).

To use a hosted model from {{es}}, create an {{infer}} endpoint with `"service": "jinaai"` and set `model_id` to the name of the model you want to use.

The following example creates a `rerank` endpoint for `jina-colbert-v2`:

```console
PUT _inference/rerank/jina-colbert-v2-external
{
  "service": "jinaai",
  "service_settings": {
    "api_key": "<api_key>", <1>
    "model_id": "jina-colbert-v2" <2>
  }
}
```

1. Your Jina AI API key.
2. The model to use for the {{infer}} task.

You can reference the `inference_id` of this endpoint in search queries.

For more information about creating Jina AI {{infer}} endpoints, including `text_embedding`, `embedding` and `rerank` task types, refer to the [create a JinaAI {{infer}} endpoint]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-inference-put-jinaai) API documentation.

#### On-prem [jina-on-prem]

With [Jina on-prem](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-on-prem), you run Jina models in Docker containers on your own infrastructure and access them through the Jina API schemas exposed by the container. Use this option for air-gapped or network-restricted environments, offline inference, or compliance and data residency scenarios that require self-hosted model deployment.

To pull, transfer, and run a prebuilt Docker image, refer to the [Jina on-prem Quick Start](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-on-prem/wiki/Quick-Start).

For supported text embedding and reranking models, you can connect {{es}} to the local server through {{infer}} endpoints that call the APIs exposed by the container. For the models that support this {{es}} integration, refer to the [model overview](#jina-model-overview) tables.

##### Text embedding [jina-on-prem-text-embedding]

Create a `text_embedding` endpoint with the `openai` service type so {{es}} sends OpenAI-compatible embedding requests to the Jina on-prem `/v1/embeddings` API:

```console
PUT _inference/text_embedding/jina-embed
{
  "service": "openai", <1>
  "service_settings": {
    "url": "http://embed-host:8080/v1/embeddings", <2>
    "model_id": "jina-embeddings-v5-text-small", <3>
    "api_key": "not-needed" <4>
  }
}
```

1. Use the `openai` service type so {{es}} sends OpenAI-compatible `text_embedding` requests.
2. Point `url` to the `/v1/embeddings` endpoint on your Jina on-prem host.
3. Set `model_id` to the embedding model running in the container.
4. This field is required by the {{es}} {{infer}} API but is not used by Jina on-prem. Specify any placeholder string, such as `not-needed`.

You can reference the `inference_id` of this endpoint in index mappings for the [`semantic_text`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md) field type, {{infer}} processors, or search queries.

##### Rerank [jina-on-prem-rerank]

Create a `rerank` endpoint with the [`custom`]({{es-apis}}operation/operation-inference-put-custom) service so {{es}} can call the Jina on-prem `/v1/rerank` API:

```console
PUT _inference/rerank/jina-on-prem-reranker-v2-custom
{
  "service": "custom", 
  "service_settings": {
    "url": "http://rerank-host:8084/v1/rerank", <1>
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "request": """
    {
      "model": "jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual",
      "query": ${query},
      "documents": ${input}
    }
    """, <2>
    "response": { <3>
      "json_parser": {
        "relevance_score": "$.results[*].relevance_score",
        "reranked_index": "$.results[*].index"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Set `url` to the `/v1/rerank` endpoint exposed by the Jina on-prem container.
2. Define the JSON body that Elasticsearch sends to Jina for each reranking request. `model` identifies the model running in the container. At inference time, Elasticsearch replaces `${query}` with the search query and `${input}` with the documents to rerank.
3. Define how Elasticsearch extracts the reranking results from the Jina response. `relevance_score` reads the score assigned to each document, and `reranked_index` reads the document's original position in the input list.

You can reference the `inference_id` of this endpoint in `rerank` {{infer}} tasks or in a [`text_similarity_reranker`](/solutions/search/ranking/semantic-reranking.md) retriever.

You can also call any model running in a Jina on-prem container directly from your application or preprocessing pipeline through the Jina API, without creating an {{es}} {{infer}} endpoint. For request formats and supported API schemas, refer to the [Jina on-prem API reference](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-on-prem/wiki/API-Reference).

::::{note}
For models other than text embedding and reranking, call the Jina API exposed by the on-prem container, then send the results to {{es}} for indexing or search.
::::

### Cloud marketplace endpoints [jina-cloud-marketplaces-access]

When you deploy a model from a cloud marketplace, the model runs in your cloud provider account. You access it by sending HTTP requests to the endpoint created in that environment, for example an Amazon SageMaker, Azure, or Google Cloud endpoint.

The request URL and payload format depend on the provider and listing. For current marketplace listings and provider-specific setup guidance, refer to the [Jina model catalog](https://jina.ai/models#catalog).

## Pricing and licensing [jina-pricing-licensing]

Jina models are Elastic models available under a commercial license. How you are charged depends on where you deploy models and how you access them.

- Models accessed through EIS on Elastic Hosted or Elastic Serverless are billed per million tokens, or as otherwise included in EIS. For details, refer to [Pricing](/explore-analyze/elastic-inference/eis.md#pricing) and the [Elasticsearch Serverless pricing page](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search). To use Jina models on EIS, you must have the [appropriate subscription]({{subscriptions}}) level or the trial period activated.
