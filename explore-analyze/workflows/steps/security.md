# Security action steps [workflows-security-steps]

Security action steps (`security.*`) provide named, schema-validated operations for {{elastic-sec}}. Use these instead of a generic [`kibana.request`](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/kibana.md#kibana-request) call when a named step exists for the task.

These steps are authenticated automatically using the permissions or API key of the identity executing the workflow, the same model as the [`kibana.*`](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/kibana.md) and [`cases.*`](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/cases.md) steps.

## Alert triage

Alert triage steps manage the alert lifecycle: status, assignees, and tags on individual alerts.

Use them to:

* Set alert status and manage alert tags and assignees (`security.setAlertStatus`, `security.setAlertTags`, `security.assignAlert`)

Refer to [Alert triage action steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/alert-triage.md) for shared conventions, parameters, and YAML examples.

## Attack triage

Attack triage steps manage the attack lifecycle you work with on the [Attacks page](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery/manage-discoveries-from-attacks-page.md): status, assignees, and tags on the correlated attacks that group related alerts.

Use them to:

* Set attack status and manage attack tags and assignees (`security.setAttackStatus`, `security.setAttackTags`, `security.assignAttack`)

Refer to [Attack triage action steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/attack-triage.md) for shared conventions, parameters, and YAML examples.

## Detection rules

Detection rules steps enable or disable detection rules by ID list or KQL query, with partial-failure reporting in the step output.

Use them to:

* Enable one or more detection rules (`security.enableRule`)
* Disable one or more detection rules (`security.disableRule`)

Refer to [Detection rules action steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/detection-rules.md) for shared conventions, parameters, output fields, and YAML examples.
