# Use the YAML editor [workflows-yaml-editor]

The YAML editor is the primary interface for creating and editing workflows. This page describes the editor's components and features, and explains how test runs and production runs differ.

::::{admonition} Requirements
To use workflows, you must turn on the feature and ensure your role has the appropriate privileges. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/setup.md) for more information.

You must also have the appropriate subscription. Refer to the subscription page for [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud) and [Elastic Stack/self-managed](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) for the breakdown of available features and their associated subscription tiers.

## Editor layout [workflows-editor-layout]

The editor layout is composed of the following elements:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Editor pane** | The main area for writing and editing workflows. To learn more about the expected workflow structure, refer to [](/explore-analyze/workflows.md). |
| **Actions menu** | A quick-add menu for pre-formatted [triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers.md) and [step types](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps.md). |
| **Save button** | Saves the current workflow. |
| **Run button** | Manually runs the entire workflow or an individual step. <br> - Entire workflow: Click the **Run** icon {icon}`play` (next to **Save**).  <br> - Individual step: Select the step in the editor pane, then click the **Run** icon {icon}`play`.   |
| **Executions tab** | Shows [execution history](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/monitor-workflows.md) and real-time logs. |
| **Validation logs** | Shows validation successes and failures. Some common validation errors include: <br> - Invalid YAML syntax because of incorrect indentation or formatting <br> - Missing a required field or property (for example, `name`, `type`) <br> - The step type is unknown or doesn't match a valid action <br> - Invalid template syntax because of malformed template expression.|

:::{tip}
When viewing step output in the executions panel, click the **Copy** icon next to a step name to copy its full output path to your clipboard. For example, clicking **Copy** on a step named `check_if_newer` copies `steps.check_if_newer.output.conditionResult`, which you can paste directly into your workflow YAML to reference that step's output.

## Test runs and production runs [workflows-test-vs-production-runs]

Every workflow execution is either a test run or a production run. Understanding the difference helps you iterate safely during development without affecting real processes.

| | Test run {icon}`flask` | Production run {icon}`play` |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Try out a workflow or individual step while authoring | Run an enabled workflow for real |
| **How to start** | Click **Run** {icon}`play` in the workflow editor. | Click **Run** from the workflow list, or let a configured trigger fire. |
| **Scope** | Entire workflow or a single step | Entire workflow |
| **Execution history** | Saved with a flask ({icon}`flask`) badge so you can filter for test runs. Step-level test runs are not saved in history. ![Alt text](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-test-runs.png "=700x600") | Saved without a badge. Filter the executions list by **production** to see only these runs. ![Alt text](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-filter-prod-runs.png "=700x600") |
| **Template context** | `execution.isTestRun` resolves to `true`. | `execution.isTestRun` resolves to `false`. |

You can use the `execution.isTestRun` context variable in your workflow YAML to change behavior during testing. For example, you can choose to skip sending a real notification during a test run.
