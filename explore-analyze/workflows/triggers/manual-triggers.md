# Manual triggers

Manual triggers run workflows on-demand through the UI or API. They require explicit user action to start a workflow. Use manual triggers for testing, one-off tasks, administrative actions, or workflows that require a human decision to start.

To define a manual trigger, use the following syntax:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: manual
```

This allows you to run a workflow manually by:

* Clicking **Run** in the Workflows UI
* Calling the workflow execution API, either directly or from an external system

## Input parameters

Manual triggers can accept input parameters, which you can reference in any step. When you define inputs at the workflow level, users are prompted to provide values when they run the workflow.
