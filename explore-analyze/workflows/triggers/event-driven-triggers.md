# Event-driven triggers [workflows-event-driven-triggers]

Event-driven triggers let workflows react to events elsewhere in {{kib}}. Two trigger families are available:

- **`workflows.failed`** — Fires when another workflow's execution fails. {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`
- **Cases triggers** — Fire when cases change (created, updated, status changed, attachments added, comments added). {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.5+` {applies_to}`serverless: preview`

:::{warning}
The event-driven trigger system is in technical preview, including the triggers documented on this page. The schema and semantics can change in future releases.
:::

## `workflows.failed`

Fires when any workflow execution reaches the `failed` terminal state. Use this trigger to build handler workflows that react to failures in your production workflows, for example by paging on-call, opening a case, or logging to a dedicated index for observability.

### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `workflows.failed`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. The trigger fires only when the condition matches. |

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
```

### Filter the events that fire the trigger

Use `on.condition` to narrow which failed executions trigger the handler. The value is a KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload.

Fire only on failures from a specific workflow:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.name : 'ops--rollback-deployment'"
```

Ignore failures that came from another error handler:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : false"
```

Combine conditions with KQL's `and` to filter on multiple fields:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed
    on:
      condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : false and event.workflow.spaceId : 'production'"
```

### Event payload

When a failed workflow triggers your handler, the handler runs with an `event` context that describes the failure. The payload has four groups: `workflow`, `execution`, `error`, and the top-level `timestamp` and `spaceId`.

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.spaceId` | The {{kib}} space where the failure occurred. |
| `event.timestamp` | ISO timestamp of when the event fired. |
| `event.workflow.id` | The failed workflow's ID. |
| `event.workflow.name` | The failed workflow's name. |
| `event.workflow.spaceId` | The {{kib}} space where the failed workflow ran. |
| `event.workflow.isErrorHandler` | `true` if the failed workflow was itself an error handler. Use this to prevent cascading handler loops. |
| `event.execution.id` | The failed execution's ID. |
| `event.execution.startedAt` | ISO timestamp of when the execution started. |
| `event.execution.failedAt` | ISO timestamp of when the execution failed. |
| `event.error.message` | The error message. |
| `event.error.stepId` | Identifier of the step where the failure occurred, when available. |
| `event.error.stepName` | Name of the step where the failure occurred, when available. |
| `event.error.stepExecutionId` | ID of the step execution where the failure occurred, when available. |

Reference these fields with Liquid templating inside the handler:

```yaml
- name: log_failure
  type: console
  with:
    message: |
      Workflow {{ event.workflow.name }} (id: {{ event.workflow.id }}) failed
      at step {{ event.error.stepName }}: {{ event.error.message }}
```

## Example: Page on-call when a critical workflow fails

```yaml
name: handle-critical-workflow-failures
description: Page on-call and open a case whenever a critical workflow fails.
enabled: true

triggers:
  - type: workflows.failed

steps:
  - name: skip_if_handler
    type: if
    condition: "event.workflow.isErrorHandler : true"
    steps:
      - name: no_op
        type: console
        with:
          message: "Skipping: the failure came from another error handler."

  - name: page_oncall
    if: "not event.workflow.isErrorHandler"
    type: pagerduty.triggerIncident
    connector-id: "platform-pagerduty"
    with:
      dedup_key: "{{ event.workflow.id }}-{{ event.execution.id }}"
      summary: "Workflow {{ event.workflow.name }} failed"
      severity: "critical"
      details:
        failed_step: "{{ event.error.stepName }}"
        error: "{{ event.error.message }}"
        workflow_id: "{{ event.workflow.id }}"
        execution_id: "{{ event.execution.id }}"

  - name: open_case
    if: "not event.workflow.isErrorHandler"
    type: cases.createCase
    with:
      title: "[Auto] Workflow failure: {{ event.workflow.name }}"
      description: |
        Step `{{ event.error.stepName }}` failed.

        Error: `{{ event.error.message }}`
      severity: "high"
      tags: ["workflow-failure", "auto-triage"]
```

## Cases triggers

```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.5+
serverless: preview
```

Cases triggers fire when cases change. Use them to react to case lifecycle events without polling the Cases API.

**Shared payload.** Every cases trigger event includes:

- `event.caseId` — The case ID, the alphanumeric identifier that is unique to each case.
- `event.owner` — The solution that owns the case. It can be `securitySolution` for {{elastic-sec}} cases, `observability` for Observability cases, or `cases` for Stack cases.

**Schema convention.** In each trigger's schema table below, the `Location` column indicates where each parameter sits in the trigger YAML. `top level` means the parameter sits alongside `type`; `` `on` `` means it sits inside the `on:` block, parallel to how `workflows.failed` uses `on:` for its condition.

Use `event.owner` in `on.condition` to filter by solution. For example, a workflow that only fires for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseCreated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

Individual trigger sections below document any additional payload fields specific to that event.

### `cases.caseCreated` [cases-casecreated-trigger]

Fires when a case is created.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseCreated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The new case's ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |

#### Example

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseCreated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

### `cases.caseUpdated` [cases-caseupdated-trigger]

Fires when a case is updated. The `event.updatedFields` array lists which fields changed.

This trigger also fires when a case's status changes; the dedicated [`cases.caseStatusUpdated`](#cases-casestatusupdated-trigger) trigger fires alongside it and carries the previous status for easier filtering. For bulk updates, `cases.caseUpdated` fires once per case.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseUpdated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The updated case's ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.updatedFields` | Array of field names that changed in this update. |

#### Example

Fire when a {{elastic-sec}} case's title changes:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseUpdated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution" and event.updatedFields: "title"'
```

### `cases.caseStatusUpdated` [cases-casestatusupdated-trigger]

Fires when a case's status changes.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.caseStatusUpdated`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.previousStatus` | The previous status (`open`, `in-progress`, or `closed`). |
| `event.status` | The current status (`open`, `in-progress`, or `closed`). |

#### Example

Fire when a {{elastic-sec}} case is closed:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.caseStatusUpdated
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution" and event.status: "closed"'
```

### `cases.attachmentsAdded` [cases-attachmentsadded-trigger]

Fires when attachments are added to a case. If attachments of multiple types are added in one operation (for example, three alerts and two comments), the trigger fires once per type, with one event for each type.

Adding a comment fires both this trigger (with `event.attachmentType: "comment"`) and the dedicated [`cases.commentsAdded`](#cases-commentsadded-trigger) trigger. Both exist because users don't always think of comments as attachments.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.attachmentsAdded`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.attachmentIds` | Array of attachment IDs added in this operation, all of `event.attachmentType`. |
| `event.attachmentType` | The type of attachments added, for example `"comment"` or `"alert"`. |

#### Examples

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.attachmentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

Fire only when a comment-type attachment is added:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.attachmentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.attachmentType: "comment"'
```

### `cases.commentsAdded` [cases-commentsadded-trigger]

Fires when comments are added to a case.

#### Schema

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | top level | string | Yes | Must be `cases.commentsAdded`. |
| `condition` | `on` | KQL string | No | Optional KQL predicate evaluated against the `event` payload. |

#### Event payload

| Field | Contains |
|---|---|
| `event.caseId` | The case ID. |
| `event.owner` | The case owner (`securitySolution`, `observability`, or `cases`). |
| `event.commentIds` | Array of comment IDs added in this operation. |

#### Example

Fire only for {{elastic-sec}} cases:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: cases.commentsAdded
    on:
      condition: 'event.owner: "securitySolution"'
```

## Prevent cascading handler loops

If a handler workflow itself fails, it can re-trigger itself. Two safeguards help you avoid infinite loops:

- Every event includes `event.workflow.isErrorHandler`, which is `true` when the failing workflow is itself a handler. Filter on this in your handler's logic to skip handling your own failures.
- The execution engine enforces a chain-depth limit on cascading event-driven triggers as a safety net.

In practice, keep handler workflows simpler than the workflows they monitor. A handler that only logs, opens a case, and notifies is less likely to fail than the automation it's handling.
