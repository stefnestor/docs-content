# Glossary [workflows-glossary]

Every term and acronym used in the Workflows documentation. Each entry links to the canonical reference page where one exists.

## A-B [workflows-glossary-a-b]

### Action [workflows-glossary-action]

In alerting, an operation a rule takes when it fires. Workflows runs as an action through the **Run workflow** rule action. Refer to [Alert triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/alert-triggers.md).

### Agent Builder [workflows-glossary-agent-builder]

A {{kib}} feature for building conversational AI agents. Workflows integrates as a tool provider (workflows can be called by agents) and as a step type (`ai.agent` calls agents from a workflow). Refer to [{{agent-builder}}](/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder.md).

### Alert [workflows-glossary-alert]

A document produced by an alerting rule when it fires. Refer to [Detection alert](#workflows-glossary-detection-alert).

### Alert state [workflows-glossary-alert-state]

One of `new`, `ongoing`, or `recovered`. Workflows can trigger on any combination of these states. Refer to [Alert triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/alert-triggers.md).

### Alerting rule [workflows-glossary-alerting-rule]

A {{kib}} construct that watches data and fires when a condition is met. Triggers alert-type workflows. Refer to [Alert triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/alert-triggers.md).

### Anatomy [workflows-glossary-anatomy]

The top-level structure of a workflow YAML file. Refer to [Anatomy of a workflow](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/anatomy.md).

## C [workflows-glossary-c]

### Case [workflows-glossary-case]

A {{kib}} Cases document for tracking an investigation. Workflows provides 25+ `cases.*` step types. Refer to [Cases action steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/cases.md).

### Composition [workflows-glossary-composition]

```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.4+
serverless: preview
```

Invoking one workflow from another. The parent calls a child through `workflow.execute` (synchronous) or `workflow.executeAsync` (fire-and-forget). Refer to [Composition steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/composition.md) and [Compose workflows](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/compose-workflows.md).

### Composition depth [workflows-glossary-composition-depth]

How deep a nested `workflow.execute` chain goes. Capped by the engine to prevent infinite recursion. Refer to [Composition steps](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/composition.md).

### Concurrency [workflows-glossary-concurrency]

Controls for what happens when overlapping executions would otherwise run at the same time. Configured under `settings.concurrency`. Refer to [Workflow settings](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/settings.md).

### Connector [workflows-glossary-connector]

### Context [workflows-glossary-context]

### Detection alert [workflows-glossary-detection-alert]

An alert produced by a {{elastic-sec}} detection rule. Always in state `new` when delivered to a workflow. Refer to [Alert triggers](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/alert-triggers.md).

## F-H [workflows-glossary-f-h]

### Fallback [workflows-glossary-fallback]
