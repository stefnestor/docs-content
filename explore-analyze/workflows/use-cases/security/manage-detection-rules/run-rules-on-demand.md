# Run detection rules on demand [workflows-run-rules-on-demand]

This guide walks through building a workflow that triggers a manual execution of one or more detection rules over a specific time range. Use it for gap-filling after a detection rule change, post-incident review, scheduled health checks, or any time you need to run rules outside their normal cadence.

The workflow is adapted from [`manually-run-rules.yaml`](https://github.com/elastic/workflows/blob/main/workflows/security/detection/manually-run-rules.yaml) in the `elastic/workflows` library.

If you're new to workflows, complete [Build your first workflow](/explore-analyze/workflows/get-started/build-your-first-workflow.md) first.

## Before you begin [workflows-run-rules-prereqs]

- **Permissions.** `All` on **Analytics > Workflows** and on **Security > Detection rules** in the target space. Refer to [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).
- **Rule IDs.** The `rule_id` values of the detection rules you want to run. You can copy them from the **Rules** table in {{elastic-sec}} or from a saved-object export.
- **Time range.** The lookback window for this manual run. The default in this workflow is the last 15 minutes, which matches the interval of most default rules.

## How it works [workflows-run-rules-how-it-works]

The workflow runs on demand with a list of rule IDs:

1. **Manual trigger** with a `rule_ids` array input.
2. **`foreach` step** iterates the rule IDs.
3. For each rule, a **`kibana.request` step** calls the detection engine's `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action` endpoint with the `run` action and a configurable time range.

## Build the workflow [workflows-run-rules-build]

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Declare the rule IDs and time window as inputs

Inputs make the workflow reusable without editing YAML. Declare both the list of rule IDs and the lookback window in minutes:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: rule_ids
    type: array
    description: Detection rule IDs to run.
    required: true
  - name: lookback_minutes
    type: number
    description: How many minutes back to run the rule.
    default: 15

triggers:
  - type: manual
```
::::

::::{step} Loop over the rule IDs

Use a `foreach` step to iterate. Inside the loop, `foreach.item` is the current rule ID:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: for_each_rule
    type: foreach
    foreach: "${{ inputs.rule_ids }}"
    steps:
      # Per-rule step goes here. Use foreach.item for the current rule ID.
```

Note the `${{ inputs.rule_ids }}` form. Use `${{ ... }}` whenever you're passing an array or object to a step parameter, so the value isn't stringified. Refer to [Templating engine](/explore-analyze/workflows/templating.md) for the `{{ }}` vs. `${{ }}` distinction.
::::

::::{step} Trigger the rule run with `kibana.request`

Call the detection engine's bulk action endpoint to run the rule over the lookback window. Build the `start` and `end` timestamps with Liquid date filters:

```yaml
      - name: run_rule
        type: kibana.request
        with:
          method: POST
          path: /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action
          body:
            action: run
            ids:
              - "{{ foreach.item }}"
            run:
              start_date: "{{ 'now' | date: '%s' | minus: inputs.lookback_minutes | times: 60 | date: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' }}.000Z"
              end_date: "{{ 'now' | date: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' }}.000Z"
```

The two Liquid expressions compute ISO timestamps: the start is `now - lookback_minutes minutes`, and the end is `now`. Adjust the expressions if you need a different window shape.

## Extend this workflow [workflows-run-rules-extend]

- **Run on a schedule.** Replace the `manual` trigger with a [scheduled trigger](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers/scheduled-triggers.md) that fires every hour and passes a fixed rule list through `consts`.
- **Audit before you run.** Chain a `kibana.request` `GET /api/detection_engine/rules` step first to fetch each rule's status and skip rules that are disabled or in error.
- **Summarize results.** After the loop, post the number of rules run to Slack or index a summary document with [`elasticsearch.request`](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps/elasticsearch.md) for dashboarding.
- **Stop on first failure.** Replace the per-iteration error handling with a strict `on-failure: abort` so the workflow fails fast if any one rule can't be triggered.
