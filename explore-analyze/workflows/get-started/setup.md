# Set up Workflows [workflows-setup]

To use workflows, you must turn on the feature and ensure your role has the appropriate privileges. You must also have the appropriate subscription. Refer to the subscription page for [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud) and [Elastic Stack/self-managed](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) for the breakdown of available features and their associated subscription tiers.

## Enable workflows [workflows-enable]

The workflows feature is turned off by default. To turn it on:

1. Go to the **Advanced Settings** management page in the navigation menu or using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Search for `workflows:ui:enabled`.
3. Toggle the setting on.
4. Click **Save changes** to turn on workflows in your space, then reload the page. 

The **Workflows** page displays in the main navigation menu and you can search for it using the global search field.

## Manage access to workflows [workflows-role-access]

Access to workflows is controlled by [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md). The following table describes privileges required to create, edit, run, and manage workflows.

| Action | Required privilege |
|--------|-------------------|
| Access the **Workflows** page | `All` or `Read` for **Analytics > Workflows** |
| Fully manage workflows | `All` for **Analytics > Workflows** |
| Grant access to specific workflow actions | Set sub-feature privileges for **Analytics > Workflows** | 

## What's next [workflows-what-next]

- Understand how to use the YAML editor in {{kib}} to define and run workflows. Refer to [](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/use-yaml-editor.md) to learn more.
