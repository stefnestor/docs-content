# Build your first workflow [workflows-get-started]

In this tutorial, you'll create a workflow that indexes and searches through national parks data. Along the way, you'll learn the core concepts and capabilities of workflows.

## Prerequisites [workflows-prerequisites]

- To use workflows, turn on the Elastic Workflows (`workflows:ui:enabled`) [advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md#kibana-general-settings).   
- You must have the appropriate subscription. Refer to the subscription page for [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud) and [Elastic Stack/self-managed](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) for the breakdown of available features and their associated subscription tiers.
- Access to workflows is controlled by [{{kib}} privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md). Ensure your role has `All` privileges for **Analytics > Workflows**, which allows you to create, edit, run, and manage workflows.

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Go to Workflows

To access the **Workflows** page, find **Workflows** in the navigation menu or using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

::::

::::{step} Create a new workflow

Click **Create a new workflow**. The YAML editor opens.


::::

::::{step} Define your workflow

Remove the placeholder content and copy and paste the following YAML into the editor:

```yaml

::::{step} Save your workflow

Click **Save**. Your workflow is now ready to run.

::::

::::{step} Run your workflow

Click the **Run** icon {icon}`play` (next to **Save**) to execute your workflow.

::::

::::{step} Monitor execution

As your workflow runs, execution logs display in a panel next to your workflow. In the panel, you can find:

* **Real-time execution logs**: Each step appears as it executes.
* **Worfklow status indicators**: Green for success, red for failures, and timestamps for duration.
* **Expandable step details**: Click any step to see input, output, and timeline.

::::

::::{step} View execution history

To examine past executions:

1. Click the **Executions** tab.
2. View a list of all workflow runs (including pending and in progress runs), along with their status and completion time.
3. Click any execution to see its detailed logs.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing failed execution with error details -->

## Understand what happened

Let's examine each part of the workflow to understand how it works.

:::::{stepper}

::::{step} Workflow metadata

```yaml
name: 🏔️ National Parks Demo
description: Creates an Elasticsearch index, loads sample national park data using bulk operations, searches for parks by category, and displays the results.
enabled: true
tags: ["demo", "getting-started"]
```

* **`name`**: A unique identifier for your workflow.
* **`description`**: Explains the workflow's purpose.
* **`enabled`**: Controls whether the workflow can be run.
* **`tags`**: Labels for organizing and finding workflows.

::::

::::{step} Constants

```yaml
consts:
  indexName: national-parks-data
```

* **`consts`**: Defines reusable values that can be referenced throughout the workflow. Use constants for fixed values that don't change between runs. For values that vary per execution, use [inputs](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/pass-data-handle-errors.md#workflows-constants-or-inputs) instead.
* Accessed using template syntax: `{{ consts.indexName }}`. This promotes consistency and makes the workflow easier to maintain.

::::

::::{step} Triggers

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: manual
```

* **`triggers`**: Defines how the workflow starts.
* **`type`**: Specifies the trigger type. Manual triggers require explicit user action (clicking the **Run** icon {icon}`play`) to start a workflow.

::::

::::{step} Create index

```yaml
- name: create_parks_index
  type: elasticsearch.indices.create
  with:
    index: "{{ consts.indexName }}"
    settings:
      number_of_shards: 1
      number_of_replicas: 0
    mappings:
      properties:
        name: { type: text }
        category: { type: keyword }
        description: { type: text }
```

* **Step type**: This is an action step that directly interacts with {{es}}.
* **Step purpose**: Establishes the data structure for the park information, ensuring fields are properly typed for searching and aggregation.
* **Key elements**:
    * Uses `elasticsearch.indices.create`, which is a built-in action that maps to the {{es}} Create Index API.
    * Defines mappings to control how data is indexed (`text` for full-text search, `keyword` for exact matching).
    * References the constant `indexName` for consistency.
    * Sets index settings for optimal performance in this demo.

::::

::::{step} Bulk index documents

```yaml
- name: bulk_index_park_data
  type: elasticsearch.request
  with:
    method: POST
    path: /{{ consts.indexName }}/_bulk?refresh=wait_for
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/x-ndjson
    body: |
      {"index":{}}
      {"name": "Yellowstone National Park", "category": "geothermal", "description": "America's first national park, established in 1872, famous for Old Faithful geyser and diverse wildlife including grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk."}
      {"index":{}}
      {"name": "Grand Canyon National Park", "category": "canyon", "description": "Home to the immense Grand Canyon, a mile deep gorge carved by the Colorado River, revealing millions of years of geological history in its colorful rock layers."}
    # ... additional parks
```

* **Step type**: A generic {{es}} request action that calls the bulk API directly.
* **Step purpose**: Efficiently loads multiple documents in a single operation, populating the index with sample data.
* **Key elements**:
    * Uses `elasticsearch.request` with `method: POST` to call the `/<index>/_bulk` endpoint.
    * The `refresh=wait_for` query parameter ensures documents are searchable immediately after indexing.
    * The `headers` parameter sets `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson`, which is required for bulk operations.
    * The `body` uses the pipe (`|`) syntax to define a multiline string in YAML.
    * Each pair of lines represents an action (such as `{"index":{}}`) followed by the document to index.
    * Uses the field names (`name`, `category`, `description`) from the mappings defined in the `create_parks_index` step.
    * This step demonstrates how to handle batch operations using the generic request action.

::::

::::{step} Search parks

```yaml
- name: search_park_data
  type: elasticsearch.search
  with:
    index: "{{ consts.indexName }}"
    size: 5
    query:
      term:
        category: "canyon"
```

* **Step type**: Internal action step for querying {{es}}.
* **Step purpose**: Retrieves specific data based on criteria, demonstrating how workflows can make decisions based on data.
* **Key elements**:
    * Searches for parks with category `"canyon"` (will find Grand Canyon and Zion).
    * Results from `steps.search_park_data.output` are automatically available to subsequent steps.
    * Limits results to 5 documents for manageable output.
    * Shows how workflows can filter and process data dynamically.

::::

::::{step} Log results

```yaml
- name: log_results
  type: console
  with:
    message: |-
      Found {{ steps.search_park_data.output.hits.total.value }} parks in category "canyon".
      Top results: {{ steps.search_park_data.output.hits.hits | json:2 }}
```

* **Step type**: A console step for output and debugging.
* **Step purpose**: Presents the results in a human-readable format, demonstrating how to access and format data from previous steps.
* **Key elements**:
    * Template variables access the search results: `{{ steps.search_park_data.output }}`.
    * The `| json:2` filter formats JSON output with indentation.
    * Uses the exact step name `search_park_data` to reference previous step output.
    * Shows how data flows through the workflow and can be transformed.

## Key concepts demonstrated

This workflow introduces several fundamental concepts:

* **Action steps**: Built-in steps that interact with {{es}} APIs.
* **Data flow**: How information moves from step to step using outputs and template variables.
* **Constants**: Reusable values that make workflows maintainable.
* **Template syntax**: The `{{ }}` notation for dynamic values.
* **Step chaining**: How each step builds on previous ones to create a complete process.

## What's next

* [**Triggers**](/explore-analyze/workflows/triggers.md): Control when workflows run.
* [**Steps**](/explore-analyze/workflows/steps.md): Define how a workflow operates and the outcomes it can produce.
* [**Pass data and handle errors**](/explore-analyze/workflows/authoring-techniques/pass-data-handle-errors.md): Make the workflow resilient to failures and understand mechanisms for controlling data flow.
