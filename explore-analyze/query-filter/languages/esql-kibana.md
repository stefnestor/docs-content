# Use ES|QL in the {{kib}} UI [esql-kibana]

The {{esql}} editor lets you write, run, and manage [{{esql}}](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax-reference.md) queries across {{kib}}. Use it to query and aggregate your data, create visualizations, and set up alerts.

The {{esql}} editor is available in the following areas of {{kib}}:

- [**Discover**](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md): Explore and analyze your data using {{esql}} queries, visualize results, and save your findings to dashboards.
- [**Dashboards**](/explore-analyze/dashboards.md): Create {{esql}}-powered visualization panels and interactive controls.
- [**Alerting**](/explore-analyze/alerting/alerts/rule-type-es-query.md): Create alerting rules based on {{esql}} queries.
- [**{{elastic-sec}} solution**](/solutions/security/esql-for-security.md): Use {{esql}} for threat hunting, detection rules, and investigation workflows.

Find the complete list of supported commands, functions, and operators in the [{{esql}} reference](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax-reference.md).

## Write queries with the {{esql}} editor [esql-kibana-get-started]


### Query structure [esql-kibana-query-bar]

Every {{esql}} query starts with a [source command](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-source-commands) that retrieves data:

- [`FROM`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/source-commands.md#esql-from) retrieves data from data streams, indices, or aliases.
- [`TS`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/ts.md) is optimized for querying time series data streams.
- {applies_to}`stack: preview 9.4` {applies_to}`serverless: preview` [`PROMQL`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/promql.md) queries time series data through the {{esql}} editor using [Prometheus Query Language (PromQL)](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) syntax.

You can then chain one or more [processing commands](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-processing-commands) using pipe (`|`) characters. For example, [`WHERE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-where) filters rows and [`STATS`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-stats-by) aggregates data:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE response.keyword == "200"
| STATS total_bytes = SUM(bytes) BY geo.dest
```

When querying many indices at once without filters, the response might be too large. If you encounter a content length error, use [`DROP`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-drop) or [`KEEP`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-keep) to limit the number of fields returned.

::::{note}
{{esql}} keywords are case-insensitive. `FROM`, `from`, and `From` are all equivalent.
::::


### Editor tools

The {{esql}} editor includes several built-in tools to help you write queries efficiently.

#### Autocomplete and in-app help

{{esql}} features in-app help, inline suggestions, and an autocomplete menu so you can get started faster and don't have to leave the application to check syntax.

![The ES|QL syntax reference and the autocomplete menu](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-esql-in-app-help.png "")

#### Query formatting [_make_your_query_readable]

For readability, you can put each processing command on a new line and add indentation. Use the {icon}`pipeBreaks` **Prettify query** button from the query editor's footer to format your query automatically. You can also adjust the editor's height by dragging its bottom border.

:::{image} /explore-analyze/images/esql-line-breakdown.gif
:alt: Automatic line breaks and indentation for ES|QL queries
:width: 75%
:::

#### Warnings [_warnings]

A query might result in warnings, for example when querying an unsupported field type. When that happens, the query bar displays a warning symbol. To see the detailed warning, expand the query bar, and select **warnings**.

#### Query statistics
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4
serverless: ga
```

After running a query, the editor's footer displays statistics about the last run, including the number of documents processed. These statistics are available in **Discover** and in **{{esql}} visualizations** in dashboards.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

| Mac                | Windows/Linux       | Description                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| {kbd}`cmd+enter`   | {kbd}`ctrl+enter`   | Run a query                 |
| {kbd}`cmd+/`       | {kbd}`ctrl+/`       | Comment or uncomment the current line or selected lines |
| {kbd}`cmd+i`       | {kbd}`ctrl+i`       | [Prettify query](#_make_your_query_readable) {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.4+` |
| {kbd}`cmd+k`       | {kbd}`ctrl+k`       | Open [Quick search](#esql-kibana-quick-search) |

:::{tip}
You can find the list of shortcuts directly from the editor. Look for the ![keyboard](../../images/keyboard.svg "keyboard =2%") icon.
:::


### Free-text quick search [esql-kibana-quick-search]
```{applies_to}
serverless: preview
stack: preview 9.3+
```

You can use the **Quick search** functionality of the {{esql}} editor to translate a free-text or KQL search into a functioning {{esql}} query with a `WHERE KQL()` clause. This can be useful if you're getting started with {{esql}} or are familiar with [KQL](kql.md).

1. Select **Quick search** in the editor's footer, or press {kbd}`cmd+k` (Mac) or {kbd}`ctrl+k` (Windows/Linux) to open the **Quick search** bar.
2. Select the data sources to search.
3. Type the text you want to search for as free text or using [KQL](kql.md) syntax.
4. Submit your search by pressing **Enter**. The editor generates a new {{esql}} query that overwrites the current query and runs it. It includes a `FROM` command based on the data sources you selected (or `TS` if the data source is a time series data stream), and a `WHERE KQL()` command that contains the text you typed in the search bar. The editor saves previously run queries in the query history if you need to restore them. 

   The **Quick search** bar closes automatically when you press **Enter**, start typing in the editor or click outside of it.

5. Refine your query with any other {{esql}} command or function that you need.

![Quick search bar in the ES|QL editor](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc8165d27051bdac3/6997303fcf7e250008e681d8/esql-quick-search.gif "=60%")


### Commands with additional editor support

Some {{esql}} commands have dedicated editor features beyond autocomplete, such as in-editor index or policy creation.

#### LOOKUP JOIN command and lookup indices

The {{esql}} editor supports [`LOOKUP JOIN`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-lookup-join) commands and suggests lookup mode indices and join condition fields.

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2.0` Remote lookup joins are supported in [cross-cluster queries](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-cross-clusters.md). The lookup index must exist on _all_ remote clusters being queried, because each cluster uses its local lookup index data.

In **Discover**, LOOKUP JOIN commands let you create or edit lookup indices directly from the editor. Find more information in [](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md#discover-esql-lookup-join).


#### ENRICH command and enrich policies [esql-kibana-enrich]

The {{esql}} [`ENRICH`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-enrich) command enables you to [enrich](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md) your query dataset with fields from another dataset. Before you can use `ENRICH`, you need to [create and execute an enrich policy](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md#esql-set-up-enrich-policy). If a policy exists, autocomplete suggests it. If not, select **Click to create** to create one.

:::{image} /explore-analyze/images/elasticsearch-reference-esql-kibana-enrich-autocomplete.png
:alt: esql kibana enrich autocomplete
:width: 50%
:::

For detailed steps to create an enrich policy from the editor, refer to [Enrich your data](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-enrich-data.md).


## Filter by time [esql-kibana-time-filter]

To display data within a specified time range, you can use the standard time filter, custom time parameters, or a WHERE command.


### Standard time filter [_standard_time_filter]

{{kib}} enables the standard [time filter](../filtering.md) when the indices you're querying have a field named `@timestamp`.


### Custom time parameters [_custom_time_parameters]

If your indices do not have a field named `@timestamp`, you can use the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters to specify a time range. These parameters work with any timestamp field and automatically sync with the [time filter](../filtering.md).

```esql
FROM my_index
| WHERE custom_timestamp >= ?_tstart AND custom_timestamp < ?_tend
```

You can also use the `?_tstart` and `?_tend` parameters with the [`BUCKET`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/grouping-functions/bucket.md) function to create auto-incrementing time buckets in {{esql}} visualizations. For example:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| STATS average_bytes = AVG(bytes) BY BUCKET(@timestamp, 50, ?_tstart, ?_tend)
```


### Time ranges with WHERE [_where_command]

You can also limit the time range using the [`WHERE`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-where) command and the [`NOW`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/date-time-functions/now.md) function. For example, if the timestamp field is called `timestamp`, to query the last 15 minutes of data:

```esql
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE timestamp > NOW() - 15minutes
```


### Timezone handling [esql-kibana-timezone]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4
serverless: ga
```

{{esql}} queries use a timezone for date and time functions and time-based filtering. When you run {{esql}} queries in Discover, dashboards, alerting, or Maps, {{kib}} automatically uses the timezone from the **Time zone** (`dateFormat:tz`) [advanced setting](kibana://reference/advanced-settings.md). To change it:

1. Go to **Stack Management** → **Advanced Settings** (or **Management** → **Advanced Settings** in {{serverless-short}}).
2. Search for **Time zone** (`dateFormat:tz`).
3. Set it to **Browser** to use your browser's timezone, or choose a specific timezone such as **UTC** or **America/New_York**.

:::{warning}
Avoid using the {{esql}} [`SET time_zone`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/set.md) directive in {{kib}} apps. `SET time_zone` changes how dates are computed by {{es}}, but {{kib}} still displays timestamps following the timezone defined in its `dateFormat:tz` advanced setting, which can produce confusing results.
:::



## Use variables and controls [add-variable-control]

{{esql}} variables help you add interactive controls to your queries and make them more dynamic.

They're available for:
* [Discover queries](/explore-analyze/discover/try-esql.md#add-variable-control) {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2`
* [{{esql}} visualizations in dashboards](/explore-analyze/dashboards/add-controls.md#add-variable-control)

## Manage queries

The {{esql}} editor keeps track of your queries so you can reuse and organize them.

![ES|QL editor query history and starred queries](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt2d3183eafde13ca0/699889744357070008f66a99/query_history_starred.gif "=60%")

### Query history [esql-kibana-query-history]

You can reuse your recent {{esql}} queries in the query bar. In the query bar, select **Show recent queries**.

You can then: 
- scroll through your most recent queries
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2` search for specific queries of your history

:::{note}
The maximum number of queries in the history depends on the version you're using:
- {applies_to}`serverless: ga` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2+` The query history can keep up to 50 KB of queries, which represents about 200 large queries, or about 300 short queries.
- {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.0-9.1` The query history keeps your 20 most recent queries.
:::

### Starred queries [esql-kibana-starred-queries]

From the query history, you can mark some queries as favorite to find and access them faster later.

In the query bar, select **Show recent queries**.

From the **Recent** tab, you can star any queries you want.

In the **Starred** tab, find all the queries you have previously starred.


## Define query settings with `SET` [esql-kibana-set]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.4
serverless: ga
```

The [`SET`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/set.md) directive lets you configure how {{es}} runs your {{esql}} query. Place one or more `SET` statements at the start of your query, separated by semicolons:

```esql
SET setting_name = setting_value[, ..., settingN = valueN];
<query>
```

The {{esql}} editor autocompletes supported settings and validates their values. Settings particularly useful from {{kib}} include:

- [`approximation`](#esql-kibana-approximation): Trade exact results for speed on large `STATS` queries using random sampling.
- [`project_routing`](#esql-kibana-cps): Limit a [cross-project search](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search.md) to specific projects.

The `SET` directive also supports a `time_zone` setting. However, to change the timezone used by your {{esql}} queries in {{kib}}, update the `dateFormat:tz` advanced setting rather than using `SET time_zone`. Refer to [Timezone handling](#esql-kibana-timezone) for more information.

For the full list of supported settings and their parameters, refer to the [`SET` directive reference](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/set.md).


### Approximate `STATS` results with `SET approximation` [esql-kibana-approximation]
```{applies_to}
stack: preview 9.4
serverless: preview
```

When exact results are not strictly necessary, you can enable [approximate results](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-query-approximation.md) for [`STATS`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands.md#esql-stats-by) queries. {{es}} rewrites the query to use random sampling and returns estimates together with confidence intervals. The performance benefit grows with the size of the source data.

To approximate a `STATS` query with default settings, prepend `SET approximation=true;` to your query:

```esql
SET approximation=true;
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs
| WHERE @timestamp >= NOW()-30d
| STATS total_hits = COUNT(),
        avg_bytes = AVG(bytes)
  BY geo.dest
| SORT total_hits DESC
| LIMIT 5
```

To tune the sample size or disable confidence intervals, pass a map. For example:

- `SET approximation={"rows":5000000};` increases the sample size from the default.
- `SET approximation={"confidence_level":null};` skips confidence interval computation for additional speedup.

The editor autocompletes these map parameters as you type.

For supported aggregation functions, output columns, tuning options, and limitations, refer to [Approximate `STATS` queries](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/esql-query-approximation.md).


### Search across projects with `SET project_routing` [esql-kibana-cps]
```{applies_to}
serverless: preview
stack: unavailable
```

When [{{cps}}](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search.md) is enabled and you have [linked projects](/deploy-manage/cross-project-search-config/cps-config-link-and-manage.md), you can add [`SET project_routing`](elasticsearch://reference/query-languages/esql/commands/set.md) at the beginning of your {{esql}} query to [override the {{cps}} scope](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-manage-scope.md#cps-in-kibana) and target specific projects:

```esql
SET project_routing = "_alias:my_other_project";
FROM logs-*
| WHERE log.level == "error"
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY service.name
```

The editor autocompletes two built-in values when you type `SET project_routing`:

- `_alias:_origin`: Search only the current (origin) project.
- `_alias:*`: Search all linked projects.

You can use any valid [project routing expression](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-project-routing.md), including tag-based and named expressions. For more details on query-level overrides, refer to [Managing {{cps}} scope](/explore-analyze/cross-project-search/cross-project-search-manage-scope.md#cps-query-overrides).
