This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Go 
client, shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.


## Requirements

* Go 1.13 or higher installed on your system.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Go client with the following 
commands:

```bash
go get -u github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-serverless-go@latest
```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Cloud URL:

```go
client, err := elasticsearch.NewClient(elasticsearch.Config{
	APIKey: "you_api_key",
	Address: "https://my-project-url",
})
```

To get API keys or the Cloud URL for a project, see <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchGetStarted" />.


## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can 
use the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete 
several documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```go
books := []Book{
    {Name: "Snow Crash", Author: "Neal Stephenson", ReleaseDate: "1992-06-01", PageCount: 470},
    {Name: "Revelation Space", Author: "Alastair Reynolds", ReleaseDate: "2000-03-15", PageCount: 585},
    {Name: "1984", Author: "George Orwell", ReleaseDate: "1949-06-08", PageCount: 328},
    {Name: "Fahrenheit 451", Author: "Ray Bradbury", ReleaseDate: "1953-10-15", PageCount: 227},
    {Name: "Brave New World", Author: "Aldous Huxley", ReleaseDate: "1932-06-01", PageCount: 268},
    {Name: "The Handmaid's Tale", Author: "Margaret Atwood", ReleaseDate: "1985-06-01", PageCount: 311},
}
indexName := "books"

bulk := client.Bulk()
for _, book := range books {
    bulk.CreateOp(types.CreateOperation{Index_: &indexName}, book)
}
response, err := bulk.Do(context.TODO())

fmt.Printf("%#v", response.Items)
```

When you use the client to make a request to Elasticsearch, it returns an API 
response object. You can access the body values directly as seen on
the previous example with `res`.


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```go
client.Get("my_index", id).Do(context.TODO())
```


### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```go
client.Search().
	Index("books").
	Q("snow").
	Do(context.TODO())
```

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```go
client.Update("books", "document_id").
		Doc(
			struct {
				PageCount int `json:"page_count"`
			}{PageCount: 312},
		).
		Do(context.TODO())
```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```go
client.Delete("books", "document_id").Do(context.TODO())
```


### Deleting an index


```go
client.Indices.Delete("books").Do(context.TODO())
```
