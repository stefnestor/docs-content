To manage a project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/).

2. Log in to your Elastic Cloud account.

3. Select your project from the **Serverless projects** panel and click **Manage**.

From the project page, you can:

- **Rename your project**. In the **Overview** section, click **Edit** next to the project's name.

- **Manage data and integrations**. Update your project data, including storage settings, indices, and data views, directly in your project.

- **Manage API keys**. Access your project and interact with its data programmatically using Elasticsearch APIs.

- **Manage members**. Add members and manage their access to this project or other resources of your organization.

## Search Lake settings

Once ingested, your data is stored in cost-efficient, general storage. A cache layer is available on top of the general storage for recent and frequently queried data that provides faster search speed. Data in this cache layer is considered **search-ready**. 

Together, these data storage layers form your project's **Search Lake**.

The total volume of search-ready data is the sum of the following:
1. The volume of non-time series project data
2. The volume of time series project data included in the Search Boost Window

Each project type offers different settings that let you adjust the performance and volume of search-ready data, as well as the features available in your projects.

      **Search Power**
    </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      Search Power affects search speed by controlling the number of VCUs (Virtual Compute Units) allocated to search-ready data in the project. Additional VCUs provide more compute resources and result in performance gains. 

      The **Cost-efficient** Search Power setting limits the available cache size, and generates cost savings by reducing search performance.

      The **Balanced** Search Power setting ensures that there is sufficient cache for all search-ready data, in order to respond quickly to queries.

      The **Performance** Search Power setting provides more computing resources in addition to the searchable data cache, in order to respond quickly to higher query volumes and more complex queries.

      **Search Boost Window**
    </DocCell>
    <DocCell>
      Non-time series data is always considered search-ready. The **Search Boost Window** determines the volume of time series project data that will be considered search-ready. 

      Increasing the window results in a bigger portion of time series project data included in the total search-ready data volume.

      Data retention policies determine how long your project data is retained.

      You can specify different retention periods for specific data streams in your project.
