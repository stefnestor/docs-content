There are two options to create serverless projects:

- If you are an existing customer, [log in to Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/login). On the home page, you will see a new option to create serverless projects. Note that if you are already subscribed to Elastic Cloud, there is no specific trial for serverless projects. 

- If you are a new user, you can [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration), and you will be able to launch a serverless project.

## What is included in my trial?

Your free 14-day trial includes:

**One hosted deployment**

 A deployment lets you explore Elastic solutions for Search, Observability, and Security. Trial deployments run on the latest version of the Elastic Stack. They includes 8 GB of RAM spread out over two availability zones, and enough storage space to get you started. If you’re looking to evaluate a smaller workload, you can scale down your trial deployment.
Each deployment includes Elastic features such as Maps, SIEM, machine learning, advanced security, and much more. You have some sample data sets to play with and tutorials that describe how to add your own data.

**One serverless project**

 Serverless projects package Elastic Stack features by type of solution: 

- [Elasticsearch](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/what-is-elasticsearch-serverless)
- [Observability](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/observability/what-is-observability-serverless)
- [Security](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/security/what-is-security-serverless)

When you create a project, you select the project type applicable to your use case, so only the relevant and impactful applications and features are easily accessible to you.

	During the trial period, you are limited to one active hosted deployment and one active serverless project at a time. When you subscribe, you can create additional deployments and projects.

## What limits are in place during a trial?

During the free 14 day trial, Elastic provides access to one hosted deployment and one serverless project. If all you want to do is try out Elastic, the trial includes more than enough to get you started. During the trial period, some limitations apply.

**Hosted deployments**

- You can have one active deployment at a time
- The deployment size is limited to 8GB RAM and approximately 360GB of storage, depending on the specified hardware profile
- Machine learning nodes are available up to 4GB RAM
- Custom Elasticsearch plugins are not enabled

**Serverless projects**

- You can have one active serverless project at a time.
- Search Power is limited to 100. This setting only exists in Elasticsearch projects
- Search Boost Window is limited to 7 days. This setting only exists in Elasticsearch projects

**How to remove restrictions?**

To remove limitations, subscribe to [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-details.html). Elastic Cloud subscriptions include the following benefits:

- Increased memory or storage for deployment components, such as Elasticsearch clusters, machine learning nodes, and APM server.
- Create multiple deployments and projects.
- Third availability zone for your deployments.
- Access to additional features, such as cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication.

You can subscribe to Elastic Cloud at any time during your trial. Billing starts when you subscribe. To maximize the benefits of your trial, subscribe at the end of the free period. To monitor charges, anticipate future costs, and adjust your usage, check your [account usage](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-account-usage.html) and [billing history](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-history.html).

## How do I get started with my trial?

Start by checking out some common approaches for [moving data into Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html#ec-ingest-methods).

## What happens at the end of the trial?

When your trial expires, the deployment and project that you created during the trial period are suspended until you subscribe to [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-details.html). When you subscribe, you are able to resume your deployment and serverless project, and regain access to the ingested data. After your trial expires, you have 30 days to subscribe. After 30 days, your deployment, serverless project, and ingested data are permanently deleted.

If you’re interested in learning more ways to subscribe to Elastic Cloud, don’t hesitate to [contact us](https://www.elastic.co/contact).

## How do I sign up through a marketplace?

If you’re interested in consolidated billing, subscribe from the AWS Marketplace, which allows you to skip the trial period and connect your AWS Marketplace email to your unique Elastic account.

<DocCallOut title="">
	Serverless projects are only available for AWS Marketplace. Support for GCP Marketplace and Azure Marketplace will be added in the near future.
