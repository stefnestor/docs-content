    Until May 31, 2024, your serverless consumption will not incur any charges, but will be visible along with your total Elastic Cloud consumption on the [Billing Usage page](https://cloud.elastic.co/billing/usage?). Unless you are in a trial period, usage on or after June 1, 2024 will draw down from your existing Elastic Cloud credits or be billed to your active payment method.
