<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
Within an organization, users can have one or more roles and each role grants specific privileges.

You can set a role:

- globally, for all projects of the same type (Elasticsearch, Observability, or Security). In this case, the role will also apply to new projects created later.
- individually, for specific projects only. To do that, you have to set the **Role for all instances** field of that specific type to **None**.
