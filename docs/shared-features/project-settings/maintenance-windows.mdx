You can schedule single or recurring maintenance windows to temporarily reduce rule notifications.
For example, a maintenance window prevents false alarms during planned outages.

Alerts continue to be generated, however notifications are suppressed as follows:

- When an alert occurs during a maintenance window, there are no notifications.
When the alert recovers, there are no notifications--even if the recovery occurs after the maintenance window ends.
- When an alert occurs before a maintenance window and recovers during or after the maintenance window, notifications are sent as usual.

TBD: What RBAC requirements exist in serverless?
## Configure access to maintenance windows

To use maintenance windows, you must have the appropriate [subscription](((subscriptions))) and ((kib)) feature privileges.

- To have full access to maintenance windows, you must have `All` privileges for the **Management → Maintenance Windows*** feature.
- To have view-only access to maintenance windows, you must have `Read` privileges for the **Management → Maintenance Windows* feature.

For more details, refer to <DocLink id="enKibanaKibanaPrivileges">((kib)) privileges</DocLink>.

## Create and manage maintenance windows

In **((project-settings)) → ((manage-app)) → ((maint-windows-app))** you can create, edit, and archive maintenance windows.

When you create a maintenance window, you must provide a name and a schedule.
You can optionally configure it to repeat daily, monthly, yearly, or on a custom interval.

If you turn on **Filter alerts**, you can use KQL to filter the alerts affected by the maintenance window.
For example, you can suppress notifications for alerts from specific rules:

- You can select only a single category when you turn on filters.
- Some rules are not affected by maintenance window filters because their alerts do not contain requisite data. In particular, <<kibana-alerts,{stack-monitor-app}>>, <<geo-alerting,tracking containment>>, {ml-docs}/ml-configuring-alerts.html[{anomaly-jobs} health], and {ref}/transform-alerts.html[transform health] rules are not affected by the filters.

A maintenance window can have any one of the following statuses:

- `Upcoming`: It will run at the scheduled date and time.
- `Running`: It is running.
- `Finished`: It ended and does not have a repeat schedule.
- `Archived`: It is archived. In a future release, archived maintenance windows will be queued for deletion.

When you view alert details in ((kib)), each alert shows unique identifiers for maintenance windows that affected it.
