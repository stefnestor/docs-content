<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
An aggregation summarizes your data as metrics, statistics, or other analytics.
Aggregations help you answer questions like:

* What's the average load time for my website?
* Who are my most valuable customers based on transaction volume?
* What would be considered a large file on my network?
* How many products are in each product category?

((es)) organizes aggregations into three categories:

* [Metric](((ref))/search-aggregations-metrics.html) aggregations that calculate metrics,
    such as a sum or average, from field values.

* [Bucket](((ref))/search-aggregations-bucket.html) aggregations that
    group documents into buckets, also called bins, based on field values, ranges,
    or other criteria.

* [Pipeline](((ref))/search-aggregations-pipeline.html) aggregations that take input from
    other aggregations instead of documents or fields.

## Run an aggregation

You can run aggregations as part of a search by specifying the search API's `aggs` parameter. The
following search runs a [terms aggregation](((ref))/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html) on
`my-field`:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/] */}

Aggregation results are in the response's `aggregations` object:

{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"took": 78/"took": "$body.took"/] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\.$/"took": "$body.took", "timed_out": false, "_shards": "$body._shards", /] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"hits": \[\.\.\.\]/"hits": "$body.hits.hits"/] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"buckets": \[\]/"buckets":\[\{"key":"get","doc_count":5\}\]/] */}
```json
{
  "took": 78,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {...},
  "hits": {...},
  "aggregations": {
    "my-agg-name": {                            [^1]
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [...]
    }
  }
}
```
[^1]: Results for the `my-agg-name` aggregation.

## Change an aggregation's scope

Use the `query` parameter to limit the documents on which an aggregation runs:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "gte": "now-1d/d",
        "lt": "now/d"
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/] */}

## Return only aggregation results

By default, searches containing an aggregation return both search hits and
aggregation results. To return only aggregation results, set `size` to `0`:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/] */}

## Run multiple aggregations

You can specify multiple aggregations in the same request:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "aggs": {
    "my-first-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      }
    },
    "my-second-agg-name": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "my-other-field"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-other-field/http.response.bytes/] */}

## Run sub-aggregations

Bucket aggregations support bucket or metric sub-aggregations. For example, a
terms aggregation with an [avg](((ref))/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html)
sub-aggregation calculates an average value for each bucket of documents. There
is no level or depth limit for nesting sub-aggregations.

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "my-sub-agg-name": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "my-other-field"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/_search/_search?size=0/] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-other-field/http.response.bytes/] */}

The response nests sub-aggregation results under their parent aggregation:

{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\./"took": "$body.took", "timed_out": false, "_shards": "$body._shards", "hits": "$body.hits",/] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"key": "foo"/"key": "get"/] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"value": 75.0/"value": $body.aggregations.my-agg-name.buckets.0.my-sub-agg-name.value/] */}
```json
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "my-agg-name": {                            [^1]
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": [
        {
          "key": "foo",
          "doc_count": 5,
          "my-sub-agg-name": {                  [^2]
            "value": 75.0
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
[^1]: Results for the parent aggregation, `my-agg-name`.
[^2]: Results for `my-agg-name`'s sub-aggregation, `my-sub-agg-name`.

## Add custom metadata

Use the `meta` object to associate custom metadata with an aggregation:

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "my-field"
      },
      "meta": {
        "my-metadata-field": "foo"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/_search/_search?size=0/] */}

The response returns the `meta` object in place:

```json
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "meta": {
        "my-metadata-field": "foo"
      },
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
      "buckets": []
    }
  }
}
```
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\./"took": "$body.took", "timed_out": false, "_shards": "$body._shards", "hits": "$body.hits",/] */}

## Return the aggregation type

By default, aggregation results include the aggregation's name but not its type.
To return the aggregation type, use the `typed_keys` query parameter.

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?typed_keys&pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "aggs": {
    "my-agg-name": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "my-field",
        "interval": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
'

```
{/* TEST[setup:my_index] */}
{/* TEST[s/typed_keys/typed_keys&size=0/] */}
{/* TEST[s/my-field/http.response.bytes/] */}

The response returns the aggregation type as a prefix to the aggregation's name.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
Some aggregations return a different aggregation type from the
type in the request. For example, the terms, [significant terms](((ref))/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html),
and [percentiles](((ref))/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html)
aggregations return different aggregations types depending on the data type of
the aggregated field.
</DocCallOut>

{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\./"took": "$body.took", "timed_out": false, "_shards": "$body._shards", "hits": "$body.hits",/] */}
{/* TESTRESPONSE[s/"buckets": \[\]/"buckets":\[\{"key":1070000.0,"doc_count":5\}\]/] */}
```json
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "histogram#my-agg-name": {                  [^1]
      "buckets": []
    }
  }
}
```
[^1]: The aggregation type, `histogram`, followed by a `#` separator and the aggregation's name, `my-agg-name`.

## Use scripts in an aggregation

When a field doesn't exactly match the aggregation you need, you
should aggregate on a [runtime field](((ref))/runtime.html):

```bash
curl "${ES_URL}/my-index/_search?pretty" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "message.length": {
      "type": "long",
      "script": "emit(doc[\u0027message.keyword\u0027].value.length())"
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "message_length": {
      "histogram": {
        "interval": 10,
        "field": "message.length"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

Scripts calculate field values dynamically, which adds a little
overhead to the aggregation. In addition to the time spent calculating,
some aggregations like [`terms`](((ref))/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html)
and [`filters`](((ref))/search-aggregations-bucket-filters-aggregation.html) can't use
some of their optimizations with runtime fields. In total, performance costs
for using a runtime field varies from aggregation to aggregation.

## Aggregation caches

For faster responses, ((es)) caches the results of frequently run aggregations in
the [shard request cache](((ref))/shard-request-cache.html). To get cached results, use the
same [`preference` string](((ref))/search-shard-routing.html#shard-and-node-preference) for each search. If you
don't need search hits, <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataAggregations" section="return-only-aggregation-results">set `size` to `0`</DocLink> to avoid
filling the cache.

((es)) routes searches with the same preference string to the same shards. If the
shards' data doesn't change between searches, the shards return cached
aggregation results.

## Limits for `long` values

When running aggregations, ((es)) uses [`double`](((ref))/number.html) values to hold and
represent numeric data. As a result, aggregations on `long` numbers
greater than 2^53 are approximate.
