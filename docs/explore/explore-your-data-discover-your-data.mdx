With **Discover**, you can quickly search and filter your data, get information
about the structure of the fields, and display your findings in a visualization.
You can also customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard.

## Explore and query your data

This tutorial shows you how to use **Discover** to search large amounts of
data and understand what’s going on at any given time. This tutorial uses the book sample data set from the <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchGetStarted">Get started page</DocLink>.

You’ll learn to:

- **Select** data for your exploration, set a time range for that data,
search it with the ((kib)) Query Language, and filter the results.
- **Explore** the details of your data, view individual documents, and create tables
that summarize the contents of the data.
- **Present** your findings in a visualization.

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll be ready to start exploring with your own
data in **Discover**.

## Find your data

Tell ((kib)) where to find the data you want to explore, and then specify the time range in which to view that data.

1. Once the book sample data has been ingested, navigate to **Explore > Discover** and click **Create data view**.

2. Give your data view a name.

<DocImage size="xxl" url="images/discover/create-data-view.png" alt="Create a data view" />

3. Start typing in the **Index pattern** field, and Elastic looks for the names of indices, data streams, and aliases that match your input.

- To match multiple sources, use a wildcard (*), for example `b*` and any indecies with the letter `b` display.

- To match multiple single sources, enter their names, separated by a comma. Do not include a space after the comma. For example `books,magazines` would match two indices if you had an index for magazine data.

- To exclude a source, use a minus sign (-), for example `-books`.

4. In the Timestamp field dropdown, and then select **release_date**.

- If you don't set a default time field, you can't use global time filters on your dashboards. This is useful if you have multiple time fields and want to create dashboards that combine visualizations based on different timestamps.

- If your index doesn't have time-based data, choose **I don't want to use the time filter**.

5. Click Show advanced settings to:

- Display hidden and system indices.
- Specify your own data view name. For example, enter your Elasticsearch index alias name.

6. Click **Save data view to ((kib))**.

7. Adjust the time range to view data for the **Last 40 years** to view all your book data.

<div id="explore-fields-in-your-data"></div>

## Explore the fields in your data

**Discover** includes a table that shows all the documents that match your search. By default, the document table includes a column for the time field and a column that lists all other fields in the document. You’ll modify the document table to display your fields of interest.

1. In the sidebar, enter `au` in the search field to find the `author` field.

2. In the **Available fields** list, click `author` to view its most popular values.

**Discover** shows the top 10 values and the number of records used to calculate those values.

3. Click <DocIcon type="plusInCircleFilled" title="Add" /> to toggle the field into the document table. You can also drag the field from the **Available fields** list into the document table.

## Add a field to your ((data-source))

What happens if you forgot to define an important value as a separate field? Or, what if you
want to combine two fields and treat them as one? This is where [runtime fields](((ref))/runtime.html) come into play.
You can add a runtime field to your ((data-source)) from inside of **Discover**,
and then use that field for analysis and visualizations,
the same way you do with other fields.

1. In the sidebar, click **Add a field**.

2. In the **Create field** form, enter `hello` for the name.

3. Turn on **Set value**.

4. Define the script using the Painless scripting language.  Runtime fields require an `emit()`.

    ```ts
    emit("Hello World!");
    ```

5. Click **Save**.

6. In the sidebar, search for the **hello** field, and then add it to the document table.

7. Create a second field named `authorabbrev` that combines the authors last name and first initial.

    ```ts
    String str = doc['author.keyword'].value;
    char ch1 = str.charAt(0);
    emit(doc['author.keyword'].value + ", " + ch1);
    ```

8. Add `authorabbrev` to the document table.

## Search your data

One of the unique capabilities of **Discover** is the ability to combine free text search with filtering based on structured data. To search all fields, enter a simple string in the query bar.

To search particular fields and build more complex queries, use the ((kib)) Query language. As you type, KQL prompts you with the fields you can search and the operators you can use to build a structured query.

Search the ecommerce data for documents where the country matches US:

1. Enter `p`, and then select **page_count**.
2. Select **>** for greater than and enter **500**, then click the refresh button or press the Enter key to see which books have more than 500 pages.

<div id="filter-in-discover"></div>

## Filter your data

Whereas the query defines the set of documents you are interested in,
filters enable you to zero in on subsets of those documents.
You can filter results to include or exclude specific fields, filter for a value in a range,
and more.

Exclude documents where the author is not Terry Pratchett:

1. Click <DocIcon type="plusInCircleFilled" title="Add" /> next to the query bar.
2. In the **Add filter** pop-up, set the field to **author**, the operator to **is not**, and the value to **Terry Pratchett**.
3. Click **Add filter**.
4. Continue your exploration by adding more filters.
5. To remove a filter, click the close icon (x) next to its name in the filter bar.

<div id="look-inside-a-document"></div>

## Look inside a document

Dive into an individual document to view its fields and the documents that occurred before and after it.

1. In the document table, click the expand icon <DocIcon type="expand" title="View details" /> to show document details.

2. Scan through the fields and their values. If you find a field of interest, hover your mouse over the **Actions** column for filters and other options.

3. To create a view of the document that you can bookmark and share, click **Single document**.

4. To view documents that occurred before or after the event you are looking at, click **Surrounding documents**.

<div id="save-your-search"></div>

## Save your search for later use

Save your search so you can use it later, generate a CSV report, or use it to create visualizations, Dashboards, and Canvas workpads. Saving a search saves the query text, filters, and current view of **Discover**, including the columns selected in the document table, the sort order, and the ((data-source)).

1. In the upper right toolbar, click **Save**.

2. Give your search a title.

3. Optionally store tags and the time range with the search.

4. Click **Save**.

## Visualize your findings
If a field can be [aggregated](((ref))/search-aggregations.html), you can quickly visualize it from **Discover**.

1. In the sidebar, find and then click `release_date`.

2. In the popup, click **Visualize**.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
    ((kib)) creates a visualization best suited for this field.
</DocCallOut>

3. From the **Available fields** list, drag and drop `page_count` onto the workspace.

4. Save your visualization for use on a dashboard.

For geographical point fields, if you click **Visualize**, your data appears in a map.

<div id="share-your-findings"></div>

## Share your findings

To share your findings with a larger audience, click **Share** in the upper right toolbar.

<div id="alert-from-Discover"></div>

## Generate alerts

From **Discover**, you can create a rule to periodically check when data goes above or below a certain threshold within a given time interval.

1. Ensure that your data view,
    query, and filters fetch the data for which you want an alert.

2. In the toolbar, click **Alerts > Create search threshold rule**.

    The **Create rule** form is pre-filled with the latest query sent to ((es)).

3. Configure your ((es)) query and select a connector type.

4. Click **Save**.

For more about this and other rules provided in ((alert-features)), go to <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchExploreYourDataAlerting">Alerting</DocLink>.
