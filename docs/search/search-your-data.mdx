A search query, or query, is a request for information about data in ((es)) data streams or indices.

You can think of a query as a question, written in a way ((es)) understands. Depending on your data, you can use a query to get answers to questions like:

- What processes on my server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
- What users on my network ran regsvr32.exe within the last week?
- What pages on my website contain a specific word or phrase?

You run search queries using the <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchSearchYourDataTheSearchApi">search API</DocLink>. The API supports several query types and search methods:

**Search for exact values.**
Use [term-level queries](((ref))/term-level-queries.html) to filter numbers, dates, IPs, or strings based on exact values or ranges.

**Full-text search.**
Use [full-text queries](((ref))/full-text-queries.html) to query [unstructured text](((ref))/analysis.html#analysis) and find documents that best match query terms. Use <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchSearchWithSynonyms" text="synonyms" /> to search for words or phrases that have the same or similar meaning.

**Vector search.**
Store dense vectors in ((es)) and use <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchKnnSearch">approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search</DocLink> to find similar vectors.

You can also use Elastic's natural language processing (NLP) model to encode text as sparse or dense vectors. Then use <DocLink id="serverlessElasticsearchSemanticSearch" text="semantic search" /> to find data based on the intent and contextual meaning rather than matching keywords.
