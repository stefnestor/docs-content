<DocBadge template="technical preview" />

A _search_ consists of one or more queries that are combined and sent to ((es)).
Documents that match a search's queries are returned in the _hits_, or
_search results_, of the response.

A search may also contain additional information used to better process its
queries. For example, a search may be limited to a specific index or only return
a specific number of results.

You can use the [search API](((ref))/search-search.html) to search and
aggregate data stored in ((es)) data streams or indices.
The API's `query` request body parameter accepts queries written in
[Query DSL](((ref))/query-dsl.html).

For more information, refer to [The search API](((ref))/search-your-data.html).
