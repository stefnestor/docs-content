This is how an ingest pipeline that uses a text embedding model is created:

```bash
curl -X PUT "${ES_URL}/_ingest/pipeline/my-text-embeddings-pipeline" \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d'
{
  "description": "Text embedding pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "inference": {
        "model_id": "sentence-transformers__msmarco-minilm-l-12-v3",  [^1]
        "target_field": "my_embeddings",
        "field_map": {  [^2]
          "my_text_field": "text_field"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
'
```
[^1]: The model ID of the text embedding model you want to use.
[^2]: The `field_map` object maps the input document field name (which is 
`my_text_field` in this example) to the name of the field that the model expects 
(which is always `text_field`).

To ingest data through the pipeline to generate text embeddings with your chosen 
model, refer to the 
[Add the text embedding model to an inference ingest pipeline](((ml-docs))/ml-nlp-text-emb-vector-search-example.html#ex-text-emb-ingest) 
section. The example shows how to create the pipeline with the inference 
processor and reindex your data through the pipeline. After you successfully 
ingested documents by using the pipeline, your index will contain the text 
embeddings generated by the model.
