# Reduce notifications and alerts [security-reduce-notifications-alerts]

{{elastic-sec}} offers several features to help reduce the number of notifications and alerts generated by your detection rules. This table provides a general comparison of these features, with links for more details:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Rule action snoozing](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md#snooze-rule-actions) | **Stops a specific rule’s notification actions from running**.<br><br>Use to avoid unnecessary notifications from a specific rule. The rule continues to run and generate alerts during the snooze period, but its [notification actions](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-detection-rule.md#rule-response-action) don’t run.<br> |
| [Maintenance window](../../../explore-analyze/alerts/kibana/maintenance-windows.md) | **Prevents all rules' notification actions from running**.<br><br>Use to avoid false alarms and unnecessary notifications during planned outages. All rules continue to run and generate alerts during the maintenance window, but their [notification actions](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-detection-rule.md) don’t run.<br> |
| [Alert suppression](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/suppress-detection-alerts.md) | **Reduces repeated or duplicate alerts**.<br><br>Use to reduce the number of alerts created when a rule meets its criteria repeatedly. Duplicate qualifying events are grouped, and only one alert is created for each group.<br> |
| [Rule exception](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/rule-exceptions.md) | **Prevents a rule from creating alerts under specific conditions**.<br><br>Use to reduce false positive alerts by preventing trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. You can configure an exception to be used by a single rule or shared among multiple rules, but they typically don’t affect *all* rules.<br> |
