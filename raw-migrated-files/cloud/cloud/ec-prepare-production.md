# Preparing a deployment for production [ec-prepare-production]

To make sure you’re all set for production, consider the following actions:

* [Plan for your expected workloads](../../../deploy-manage/production-guidance/plan-for-production-elastic-cloud.md) and consider how many availability zones you’ll need.
* [Create a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/create-an-elastic-cloud-hosted-deployment.md) on the region you need and with a hardware profile that matches your use case.
* [Change your configuration](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/ec-customize-deployment.md) by turning on autoscaling, adding high availability, or adjusting components of the Elastic Stack.
* [Add extensions and plugins](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/add-plugins-extensions.md) to use Elastic supported extensions or add your own custom dictionaries and scripts.
* [Edit settings and defaults](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) to fine tune the performance of specific features.
* [Manage your deployment](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/manage-deployments.md) as a whole to restart, upgrade, stop routing, or delete.
* [Set up monitoring](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/stack-monitoring-on-elastic-cloud-deployments.md) to learn how to configure your deployments for observability, which includes metric and log collection, troubleshooting views, and cluster alerts to automate performance monitoring.
