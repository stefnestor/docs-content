# Stop charges for a deployment [ec-billing-stop]

Got a deployment you no longer need and don’t want to be charged for any longer? Simply delete it.

::::{important} 
**All data is lost.** Billing for usage is by the hour and any outstanding charges for usage before you deleted the deployment will still appear on your next bill.
::::


To stop being charged for a deployment:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the **Hosted deployments** card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the **Deployments** page to view all of your deployments.

    On the **Deployments** page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. Select **Delete deployment** and confirm the deletion.
