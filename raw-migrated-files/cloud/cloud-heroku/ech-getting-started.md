# Introducing Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku [ech-getting-started]

This documentation applies to Heroku users who want to make use of the Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku that is available from the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) or that can be installed from the CLI.

The add-on runs on {{ecloud}} and provides access to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), the open source, distributed, RESTful search engine. Many other features of the Elastic Stack are also readily available to Heroku users through the [Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) after you install the add-on. For example, you can use Kibana to visualize your Elasticsearch data.

[Elasticsearch Machine Learning](/explore-analyze/machine-learning.md), [Elastic Enterprise Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/index.html), [Elastic APM](/solutions/observability/apps/application-performance-monitoring-apm.md) and [Elastic Fleet Server](asciidocalypse://docs/docs-content/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/index.md) are not supported by the Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku.

To learn more about what plans are available for Heroku users and their cost, check the [Elasticsearch add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/foundelasticsearch) in the Elements Marketplace.
