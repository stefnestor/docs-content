# Enable Kibana [ech-enable-kibana2]

If your deployment didn’t include a Kibana instance initially, use these instructions to enable Kibana first. For new Elasticsearch clusters, we automatically create a Kibana instance for you that you can access directly. The use of Kibana is included with your subscription.

To enable Kibana on your deployment:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. From your deployment menu, go to the **Kibana** page.
4. Select **Enable**.

Enabling Kibana provides you with an endpoint URL, where you can access Kibana. It can take a short while to provision Kibana right after you select **Enable**, so if you get an error message when you first access the endpoint URL, wait a bit and try again.
