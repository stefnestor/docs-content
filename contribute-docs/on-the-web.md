## Suggesting quick edits

For content hosted on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs), most conceptual and narrative content is stored in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository, and most reference content is hosted in the relevant product's repository.

To make quick edits to a single page:

1. Navigate to the documentation page that needs updates.
2. Click the **Edit this page** button. This opens the file in GitHub's editor.

3. Make your changes in the editor.
4. Click **Commit changes**.
5. Write a clear, verb-focused commit message describing your changes.
6. Select **Propose changes**. This takes you to the pull request creation page where you can edit the description if necessary.
7. Select **Create pull request** to submit your changes.

An Elastician will review, merge, and propagate your change to the right places for publication.
