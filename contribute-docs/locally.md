# Contribute locally

This document describes the process to set up Elastic documentation repositories locally, enabling you to contribute effectively.

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

To write and push updates to Elastic documentation, you need the following:

* **A code editor**: We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). See [Documentation tools](tools.md) for helpful extensions.
* **Git installed on your machine**: To install Git, see [How to install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* **A GitHub account**: Sign up for an account on [Github](https://github.com/)

## Install `docs-builder` [#install-docs-builder]

There are two different ways to install and run `docs-builder`:

1. Download, extract, and run the binary (recommended).
1. Clone the repository and build the binary from source.

This guide follows the first option. If you'd like to clone the repository and build from source, learn how in the [project readme](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder?tab=readme-ov-file#docs-builder).

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} macOS & Linux

1. **Download and run the install script**

   Run this command to download and install the latest version of `docs-builder`:

   ```sh
   curl -sL https://ela.st/docs-builder-install | sh
   ```

   This downloads the latest binary to `/usr/local/bin`, makes it an executable, and installs it to your user PATH. This means you can use the `docs-builder` command from any location of your machine to deploy and run documentation repositories like `docs-builder`,  `docs-content` and so on.

   You can optionally specify a specific version to install:

   ```sh
   DOCS_BUILDER_VERSION=0.40.0 curl -sL https://ela.st/docs-builder-install | sh
   ```

2. **Run docs-builder from a docs folder**

   Use the `serve` command from any `docs` folder to start serving the documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

   ```sh
   docs-builder serve
   ```

   The path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build can be specified with `-p`.

   :::{important}
   Run `docs-builder` without `serve` to run a full build and detect errors.
   :::

To download and install the binary file manually, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/releases) on GitHub.

If you get a `Permission denied` error, make sure that you aren't trying to run a directory instead of a file. Also, grant the binary file execution permissions using `chmod +x docs-builder`.

::::

::::{tab-item} Windows

1. **Download and run the install script**

   Run this command to download and install the latest version of `docs-builder`:

   ```powershell
   iex (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://ela.st/docs-builder-install-win')
   ```

   This downloads the latest binary, makes it executable, and installs it to your user PATH.
   You can optionally specify a specific version to install:

   ```powershell
   $env:DOCS_BUILDER_VERSION = '0.40.0'; iwr -useb https://ela.st/docs-builder-install.ps1 | iex
   ```

   To download and install the binary file manually, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/releases) on GitHub.

2. **Run docs-builder from a docs folder**

   Use the `serve` command from any docs folder to start serving the documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

   ```sh
   docs-builder serve
   ```
   The path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build can be specified with `-p`.

## Clone a content repository [#clone-content]

:::{tip}
Documentation is hosted in many repositories across Elastic. If you're unsure which repository to clone, you can use the **Edit this page** link on any documentation page to determine the location of the source file.
:::

Clone the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository to a directory of your choice. The `docs-content` repository is the home for most narrative documentation at Elastic.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elastic/docs-content.git
```

## Write the docs [#write-docs]

We write docs in Markdown. Refer to our [syntax quick reference](syntax-quick-reference.md) for the flavor of Markdown we support and all of our custom directives that enable you to add a little extra pizzazz to your docs.

This documentation is **cumulative**. This means that a new set of docs is not published for every minor release. Instead, each page stays valid over time and incorporates version-specific changes directly within the content. [Learn how to write cumulative documentation](how-to/cumulative-docs/index.md).

:::{include} _snippets/tagged-warning.md
:::

## Build the docs

Before pushing your changes, verify them locally by running:

```
docs-builder
```

The build process informs you of any critical errors or warnings. It also shows less critical issues as Hints. Make sure you don't introduce any new build errors, warnings, or hints.

## Push your changes [#push-changes]

After you've made your changes locally:

* [Push your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
* [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Preview locally [#local-docs-preview]

`docs-builder` can serve docs locally. This means you can edit the source and see the result in the browser in real time.

To serve the local copy of the documentation in your browser, follow these steps:

::::::{stepper}

:::::{step} Change directory to a docs repository

For example, `docs-content`:

```sh
cd docs-content
```
:::::

:::::{step} Run `docs-builder`

Run the `docs-builder` binary with the `serve` command to build and serve the content set to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If necessary, specify the path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build with `-p`.

For example:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} macOS & Linux

```sh
docs-builder serve
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Windows

```powershell
docs-builder serve -p .\docs-content
```
:::
::::
:::::

:::::{step} Open docs in the browser
To view the documentation locally, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
