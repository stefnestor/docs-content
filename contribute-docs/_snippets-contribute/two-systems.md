Because the new documentation site only hosts documentation for newer releases, the way that you contribute depends on the version that you want to document.

For a list of versions covered on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs) (Markdown), refer to [Find docs for your product version](https://www.elastic.co/docs/get-started/versioning-availability#find-docs-for-your-product-version). Versions prior to the versions listed on that page are documented on [elastic.co/guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide). 

:::{tip}
Unversioned products, such as {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, are documented on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs).
