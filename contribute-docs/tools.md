# Documentation tools

These tools help you write documentation more efficiently, reduce context-switching, and catch errors before you commit.

## Elastic Docs Utilities extension

The [Elastic Docs Utilities extension](vscode-extension.md) for Visual Studio Code and compatible IDEs provides autocompletion for directives, frontmatter, and inline roles, along with real-time validation and variable previews. It works in the Visual Studio Code desktop application and browser-based editors.

## Vale linter

The [Vale ruleset](vale-linter.md) allows the Vale linter to check your documentation against Elastic style guide rules. It integrates with your editor and CI/CD pipeline to catch style issues before they reach production.
