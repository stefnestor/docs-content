# Writing about the UI
 
This topic covers how to write about the UI, the best verbs and prepositions to use, what to call parts of the UI, and how to guide the user through tasks.

:::::{note}
These guidelines are different from the guidelines for writing UI text. If you're looking for that, refer to [EUI](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/).
:::::

## General guidelines for writing about the UI

* Describe the prop value and tasks, and provide an example.
* Don't describe the UI piece-by-piece. Focus on use cases instead.
* Write steps for actions users can't figure out themselves.
* Keep the average number of steps between five and nine.
* Write with [active voice](./voice-tone.md). If you can add “by zombies” at the end, it's likely passive.
* Use **bold** for component names and match the capitalization as it appears in the UI.
* Use *x* (italicized) for variable text in UI component names, such as: "Click **Select all *x* rules**, and then select **Activate**."
* Test all procedures before you publish.

## Helpful, minimal, accurate

Keep these principles in mind when writing about the UI.

**Write about use cases.** Describe the purpose of the UI and its use case, and provide an example, if possible. If the UI text is doing its job, you shouldn't 
be writing, "this button does this, this tab shows that."

**Eliminate "duh" procedures.** Write documentation for complex interactions or when you want to convey content that doesn't fit on the screen. Don't write 
obvious steps, such as, "Click Save to save your document." Provide in-product assistance to minimize the number of step-by-step instructions and screen 
captures in the documentation. Both can quickly go out of date.

**Keep it focused.** Explain one way to accomplish the task and let users discover the alternative. Don't provide extraneous details.

**Test your docs as you go.** Push all the buttons and ensure that your content reflects real-world scenarios. Put yourself in your users' shoes, and 
test each step locally. Test your instructions for multiple use cases (and potentially on multiple versions if you plan to backport your changes).

## UI icons 

UI icons can be helpful to include when describing a procedure that requires the user to interact with the UI, for example, if they need to click a button or another UI element. Follow these guidelines:
- Use the approved list of [EUI icons](https://eui.elastic.co/docs/components/display/icons/). 
- Include the tooltip text, image, and alt-text for optimal accessibility. 
- Avoid using parentheses before and after the UI icon image, which can disrupt screen readers' speech and braille outputs. 
:::{dropdown} Example
    ❌ **Don't**: To display the table in fullscreen mode, click the fullscreen icon ({icon}`full_screen`).
    
    ✔️ **Do**: To display the table in fullscreen mode, click the fullscreen icon {icon}`full_screen`.

## Screenshots

Although screenshots can be worth a thousand words, they are also expensive to maintain, especially in an environment with rapid releases.

### When to use screenshots

Screenshots work best in:

- Timebound docs, such as highlights docs and blog posts
- Procedures for a complex UI
- Introductions

The following table can help you decide whether a screenshot is right for your doc.

| Ask yourself | Things to think about |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Is this part of the UI complicated enough that it would be difficult to explain with words? | If there are only a few simple actions, then it's not a good candidate for a screen capture.      |
| Am I capturing just what is pertinent to the task?   | You don't want to capture the whole screen, just the area in question and enough of the surrounding area to find it.        |
| Does this contain any confidential information, like user names or IP addresses? | If an IP address, email, or component ID is a part of the capture, it's always a good practice to anonymize it. If the information isn't important, you could blur it or Photoshop over the characters.
| When making animated GIFs, are they longer than 10-15 seconds? | For documentation, a shorter gif works best. Ensure that it's trimmed enough to show the visual and nothing else.

### Aspect ratio, resolution

When taking a screenshot:

- Use a tool like the [Window Resizer Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en)
to set the window's viewport.
  - Set the aspect ratio to 16:9 (1366x768px).
  - If the screenshots are hard to read, set the aspect ratio to 4:3
  (1024x768px) instead.
  - Use the same aspect ratio to capture all screenshots on the page.
- Set your zoom level to 100%.
- If you have made any color adjustments, reset to the default on your monitor or
  select Generic RGB.
- Avoid adding drop shadows, jagged edges, or oversized images. Drop shadows that appear natively in the Kibana chrome (for example, on the application menu) are part of the product. Only avoid drop shadows that you add yourself.
- Include only the parts of the UI that are essential to the task. Exclude the navigation menu, breadcrumbs, header, application menu, and global search field whenever you can. These elements change frequently as the Kibana chrome evolves, so capturing them in a screenshot creates ongoing maintenance work without helping the reader follow the steps.
- Add a border around the screenshot to give it definition and ensure it's not "floating" against a white background. Refer to [Screenshots](https://docs-v3-preview.elastic.dev/elastic/docs-builder/tree/main/syntax/images#screenshots) for details about the `:screenshot:` attribute.
- If you need to draw attention to a specific part of the screenshot, you can draw a border or use an annotation, such as an arrow. If you do, keep these in mind:
  - Use Elastic's [brand colors](https://eui.elastic.co/#/theming/colors/values) for the annotation. We recommend the pink accent color, hex `#F04E98`.   
  - Ensure your annotations are no more than 3px in thickness. 

### Callouts on screenshots

If the screen is very complex, it might help to add callouts:

- Number them; do not use letters.
- Order numbers from left to right, top to bottom.
- Make sure that the callout number is readable in the documentation.
- Provide an explanation for each callout.

## Referring to apps and pages

In Kibana, there are multiple ways for users to navigate to apps and pages. Depending on the environment and initial setup, users can be served with different navigations where the structure, interactions, and visible features differ.

When referring to apps or pages in the docs, and especially in tasks and tutorials, it's important that you remain as close as possible to the user's truth. For that, use one of the following solution-agnostic patterns:

- The app is directly available in the navigation menu: `Find <APP> in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).`

- The app or page is accessible through only the global search field: `To open **APP or PAGE**, find **PARENT** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).`

You can adapt these patterns and the link to the search bar documentation to match your context and scenario.

## Naming Kibana UI elements

The Kibana chrome, the persistent layout that wraps every app, evolves over time. Use these names consistently when you refer to its parts in documentation.

:::{image} images/kibana-chrome-layout.svg

:::

| Term | What it refers to |
|---|---|
| **Global header** | The top bar of the Kibana chrome that hosts global controls (for example, the global search field and the space switcher). |
| **Navigation menu** | The primary navigation panel on the left side of Kibana. Its contents and structure depend on the **Solution view** setting. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Solution view** | The per-space setting that controls the **navigation menu**. Possible values: Search, Observability, Security, or Classic. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Classic view** | The non-solution option in the **Solution view** setting. Don't use "Classic" on its own, because it's ambiguous with Discover's Classic mode. |
| **Secondary navigation** | The panel that opens to the right of the navigation menu when a top-level item expands into sub-items. |
| **Application menu** | The bar above the workspace that hosts app-specific actions. |
| **Workspace** | The main content area of the current app. |
| **Flyout** | A panel that slides in from the right of the workspace to show contextual content. |
| **Sidebar** | The global, resizable right-hand panel where plugins register apps (for example, the Agent Builder chat). |

This table covers the main parts of the interface. Some elements have sub-parts (for example, child flyouts, sidebar panels) that vary by interaction. Use the table as your starting point, then introduce additional names only when a section requires it.


## Choosing the right word

Looking for the right word? Here you'll find which words to use when writing 
about the UI. You can also refer to [Word choice](word-choice.md) and our [Accessibility guidelines](accessibility.md) for specific words and use cases. 

### Components

Use the language in this table when writing about UI components.

| Component  | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Buttons** <br> A button is a UI element that is interactive by definition: when users click it, it responds to it by performing an action. <br> Use "click" and refer to a button by its label.    | ✔️ Do: Click **New**. <br> ❌ Don't: Click the "New" button.  |
| **Checkbox and radio button** <br> Checkbox is one word. <br> Use "select" and  "clear" over "check" and "uncheck". <br> Avoid naming the component unless it adds clarity (for example in a complex UI).  | ✔️ Do: Select all index checkboxes. <br> ✔️ Do: Select **Logs**. <br> ✔️ Do: Clear **Metrics**.  |
| **Icon buttons** <br> Include the icon inline to reinforce what the user is interacting with. For the name, use the tooltip text. If the icon doesn't have a name, give it one and make it sentence case.  | ✔️ Do: Click **Apply changes**. <br> ❌ Don't: Click the icon. |
| **Key** <br> Use "press" followed by key name, or "the _Key_ key" if it adds clarity. For a key combination, use "Modifier+Key".  | ✔️ Do: In the query bar, enter your search criteria and press **Enter**. <br> ✔️ Do: Press **Command+Alt+L** to expand and collapse the current scope.  |
| **Menus** <br> Use arrows (→) to tell the user where to find the command. <br> A menu always has action items.  | Select **Manage index → Add lifecycle policy**.  |
| **Text field** <br> Use "enter" for the action and code font for user input.   | ✔️ Do: In the **Name** field, enter a unique identifier for this rollup job. <br> ✔️ Do: In **Index pattern**, enter shakes*.   |
| **Toggle ([Switch in EUI](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/forms/form-controls#switch))** <br> Refer to the UI element as a "toggle". <br> Name it only if it adds clarity for the reader. If the UI is clear enough, stay minimalist and focus on the action. <br> Use "toggle" as a noun rather than a verb. <br> Prefer using "turn on", "turn off" as a verb over "enable" or "disable".  | ✔️ Do: Turn on **Malware protection**. <br> ✔️ Do: Turn off the **Malware protection** toggle in the **Preferences** window. <br> ❌ Don't: Toggle **Malware protection** in the **Preferences** window.  |

### Menus 

* Don't use the verbs _open_ and/or _close_ when a user interacts with a menu. Use _From the menu,..._ instead.
* Refer to it as "menu." Don't call it a "dropdown menu" or "dropdown list."

### Icon versus button

* If there is no text next to an actionable, visual symbol, it's an icon.
* If there is text next to an actionable visual symbol, it's a button.
* An actionable piece of text without a visual symbol is either a link or a 
  button.
* In the docs, refer to an icon with its symbol. 
:::{dropdown} Example
    From the action menu (...), select **Delete job**.
:::
  In this example, the (...) represents the action menu icon.

### Select versus click 

To ensure clarity and precision when describing user interactions, choose the verb that matches the type of UI element and the intent of the action.

**Use "select" for choices**

Use "select" when a user is choosing an option, toggling a state, or picking an item from a set, such as a dropdown. This verb emphasizes the choice being made rather than the physical action. 

:::{dropdown} Examples
  ✔️ **Do**: Select the **Enforce HTTPS checkbox**.
  ✔️ **Do**: Select the **Logs** tab to view system events.
  ❌ **Don't**: Select the **Save** button to confirm your changes. 
:::

**Use "click" for actions** 

Use "click" when a user is initiating a process, performing a command, following a link, or needs to physically click a button or icon. Do not use "click" if the user needs to make a choice from a selection.   

:::{dropdown} Examples
  ✔️ **Do**: Click **Save** to confirm your changes.
  ✔️ **Do**: Click the **Help** icon for more information.
  ❌ **Don't**: From the action menu (...), click the **Delete** button to delete the job.
