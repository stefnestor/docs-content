# Report issues and get help

The API docs workflow is pretty complicated, and there's lots of moving parts. It takes a village to produce excellent API docs, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck or have questions.

If you're not sure who owns a specific API, check out the [API ownership table](./workflows.md) to find the right team.

## Report issues

### API docs issues

When you find a bug or gap in the API docs:

- If you're comfortable making the change, open a PR in the [relevant repo](./workflows.md)
- Alternatively, open an issue in either:
   -  [elastic/docs-content](https://www.github.com/elastic/docs-content/issues) (public repo)
   - [elastic/docs-content-internal](https://www.github.com/elastic/docs-content-internal/issues) (Elastic employees only)
