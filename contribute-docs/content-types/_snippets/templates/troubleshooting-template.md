# [Problem statement written from the user’s perspective]

<!-- REQUIRED

Describe the problem users are experiencing.

Example: EDOT Collector doesn't propagate client metadata
-->

<!-- REQUIRED

Introduction

A brief summary of what the page helps users resolve. Keep it concise and focused on the problem, not the solution. Help users quickly confirm they're in the right place by describing the issue they're experiencing.
-->

## Symptoms

<!-- REQUIRED

Describe what users observe when the problem occurs. Focus on the symptoms themselves, not their causes. Use bullet points. If applicable, include:

- Error messages
- Log output
- Missing or unexpected behavior
- Timeouts or performance issues
-->

## Diagnosis

<!-- OPTIONAL

Use a Diagnosis section when you need to help users narrow down the problem from an initial symptom before providing the resolution. This is especially useful when:

- The initial symptom requires diagnostic steps to identify the specific cause
- Multiple resolutions depend on diagnostic findings
- The same symptom can have multiple root causes

Use numbered steps or bullet points to guide users through the diagnostic process.
-->

## Resolution

<!-- REQUIRED

Provide clear, actionable steps to resolve the issue.

- Order steps from most common to least common to resolve the issue
- Numbered instructions that begin with imperative verb phrases
- Keep each step focused on a single action
- Use the stepper component
- Avoid diagnostic branching unless the problem cannot be resolved linearly.

For complex scenarios, consider these patterns:

- Multiple resolutions or "combo" resolutions: When multiple solutions can be applied together or independently, present them as a list of options (users can choose one or combine multiple approaches).

- Resolutions that differ by deployment type: When steps differ significantly by deployment type ({{ecloud}} versus self-managed versus ECK), organize by deployment type using clear headings.

- Separating diagnosis from causes and resolution: When multiple resolutions depend on diagnostic findings, use a separate Diagnosis section before Resolution to help users identify their specific situation first.

For more information about the stepper component, refer to [the syntax guide](https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/syntax/stepper/).

## Best practices

<!-- OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED 

Explain how to avoid this issue in the future. Use bullet points. Do not restate general product best practices or guidance that applies broadly beyond this issue.
-->

## Resources

<!-- OPTIONAL 

Link to related documentation for deeper context. These links are supplementary — all information required to fix the issue should already be on this page.

Avoid linking to GitHub issues, pull requests, or internal discussions. Resources should be stable, user-facing documentation.
